    "## LangChain Document Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "- LangChain represents textual inputs as Document objects that carry the text plus contextual metadata. This structure standardizes how loaders, splitters, embedders, vector stores, and retrievers interact in an LLM pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core fields\n",
    "- `page_content` (string): the raw text for the document chunk.\n",
    "- `metadata` (dict): JSON-serializable key/value pairs (e.g., `{\"source\": \"...\", \"page\": 2, \"author\": \"...\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}`).\n",
    "- `id` (optional string): unique identifier for the document or chunk.\n",
    "- (Implementations may add other attrs such as embeddings when stored in a VectorStore.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical pipeline\n",
    "1. DocumentLoaders: read files, PDFs, HTML, S3, etc. -> produce full Document(s).\n",
    "2. TextSplitters: split long documents into chunks (200 - 1000 tokens) with overlap for context.\n",
    "3. Embeddings: convert chunks into vectors.\n",
    "4. VectorStore: persist vectors + metadata for efficient similarity search.\n",
    "5. Retriever: fetch relevant Document(s) for a query.\n",
    "6. Chains/Prompting: format retrieved content into prompts for the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best practices\n",
    "- Keep `metadata` small and JSON-serializable (avoid storing large binary blobs).\n",
    "- Include provenance fields: `source`, `page`, `url`, `timestamp`, and optionally a content hash.\n",
    "- Use consistent chunk size and overlap tuned to your model/context window.\n",
    "- Preserve original document IDs so you can trace chunks back to sources.\n",
    "- Normalize text (unicode, whitespace) before chunking and embedding.\n",
    "- If you need to store structured data, keep it in metadata (not inside `page_content`).\n"

It consisted of an old wooden packing box that I put shelves in. I had a heater, and \\nI\\'d put in fat and cook french-fried potatoes all the time. I also had a storage battery, and a lamp bank. \\nTo build the lamp bank I went down to the five-and-ten and got some sockets you can screw down to a wooden base, and connected them with \\npieces of bell wire. By  making different combinations of switches--in series or parallel--I knew I could get different voltages. But what I hadn\\'t \\nrealized was that a bulb\\'s resistance depends on its temperature, so the results of my calculations weren\\'t the same as the stuff that came out of the \\ncircuit. But it was all right, and when the bulbs were in series, all half-lit, they would gloooooooooow, very pretty--it was great! \\nI had a fuse in the system so if I shorted anything, the fuse would blow. Now I had to have a fuse that was weaker than the fuse in the house, so I \\nmade my own fuses by taking tin foil and wrapping it around an old burnt-out fuse. Across my fuse I had a five-watt bulb, so when my fuse blew, the \\nload from the trickle charger that was always charging the storage battery would light up the bulb. The bulb was on the switchboard behind a piece of \\nbrown candy paper (it looks red when a light\\'s behind it)--so if something went off, I\\'d look up to the switchboard and there would be a big red spot \\nwhere the fuse went. It was fun! \\nI enjoyed radios. I started with a crystal set that I bought at the store, and I used to listen to it at night in bed while I was going to sleep, through a \\npair of earphones. When my mother and father went out until late at night, they would come into my room and take the earphones off--and worry \\nabout what was going into my head while I was asleep. \\nAbout that time I invented a burglar alarm, which was a very simple-minded thing: it was just a big battery and a bell connected with some wire. \\nWhen the door to my room opened, it pushed the wire against the battery and closed the circuit, and the bell would go off. \\nOne night my mother and father came home from a night out and very, very quietly, so as not to distur b the child, opened the door to come into \\nmy room to take my earphones off. All of a sudden this tremendous bell went off with a helluva racket --BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG!!! I \\njumped out of bed yelling, \"It worked! It worked!\" \\nI had a Ford coil--a spark coil from an automobile--and I had the spark terminals at the top of my switchboard. I would put a Raytheon RH tube, \\nwhich had argon gas in it, across the terminals, and the spark would make a purple glow inside the vacuum--it was just great! \\nOne day I was playing with the Ford coil, punching holes in paper with the sparks, and the paper caught on fire. Soon I couldn\\'t hold it any more \\nbecause it was burning near my fingers, so I dropped it in a metal wastebasket which had a lot of newspapers in it. Newspapers burn fast, you know, \\nand the flame looked pretty big inside the room. I shut the door so my mother--who was playing bridge with some friends in the living room--\\nwouldn\\'t find out there was a fire in my room, took a magazine that was lying nearby, and put it over the wastebasket to smother the fire. \\nAfter the fire was out I took the magazine off, but now the room began to fill up with smoke. The wastebasket was still too hot to handle, so I got \\na pair of pliers, carried it across the room, and held it out the window for the smoke to blow out. \\nBut because it was breezy outside, the wind lit the fire again, and now the magazine was out of reach. So I pulled the flaming wastebasket back \\nin through the window to get the magazine, and I noticed there were curtains in the window--it was very dangerous! \\nWell, I got the magazine, put the fire out again, and this time kept the magazine with me while I shook the glowing coals out of the wastepaper \\nbasket onto the street, two or three floors below. Then I went out of my room, closed the door behind me, and said to my mother, \"I\\'m going out to \\nplay,\" and the smoke went out slowly through the windows. \\nI also did some things with electric motors and built an amplifier for a photo cell that I bought that could make a bell ring when I put my hand in \\nfront of the cell. I didn\\'t get to do as much as I wanted to, because my mother kept putting me out all the time, to play. But I was often in the house, \\nfiddling with my lab. \\nI bought radios at rummage sales. I didn\\'t have any money, but it wasn\\'t very expensive-they were old, broken radios, and I\\'d buy them and try to \\nfix them. Usually they were broken in some simple-minded way--some obvious wire was hanging loose, or a coil was broken or partly unwound--so I \\ncould get some of them going. On one of these radios one night I got WACO in Waco, Texas--it was tremendously exciting! \\nOn this same tube radio up in my lab I was able to hear a station up in Schenectady called WGN. Now, all of us kids-- my two cousins, my sister, \\nand the neigh borhood kids--listened on the radio downstairs to a program called the Eno Crime Club--Eno effervescent salts--it was the thing! Well, I \\ndiscovered that I could hear this program up in my lab on WGN one hour before it was broadcast in New York! So I\\'d discover what was going to \\nhappen, and then, when we were all sitting around the radio downstairs listening to the Eno Crime Club, I\\'d say, \"You know, we haven\\'t heard from \\nso-and-so in a long time. I betcha he comes and saves the situation.\" \\nTwo seconds later, bup-bup, he comes! So they all got excited about this, and I predicted a couple of other things. Then they realized that there \\nmust be some trick to it--that I must know, somehow. So I owned up to what it was, that I could hear it upstairs the hour before. \\nYou know what the result was, naturally. Now they couldn\\'t wait for the regular hour, They all had to sit upstairs in my lab with this little creaky \\nradio for half an hour, listening to the Eno Crime Club from Schenectady. \\nWe lived at that time in a big house; it was left by my grandfather to his children, and they didn\\'t have much money aside from the house. It was \\na very large, wooden house, and I would run wires all around the outside, and had plugs in all the rooms, so I could always listen to my radios, which \\nwere upstairs in my lab. I also had a loudspeaker--not the whole speaker, but the part without the big horn on it. \\nOne day, when I had my earphones on, I connected them to the loudspeaker, and I discovered something: I put my finger in the speaker and I \\ncould hear it in the earphones; I scratched the speaker and I\\'d hear it in the earphones. So I discovered that the speaker could act like a microphone, \\nand you didn\\'t even need any batteries. At school we were talking about Alexander Graham Bell, so I gave a demonstration of the speaker and the \\nearphones. I didn\\'t know it at the time, but I think it was the type of telephone he originally used.'),\n",

At that time my sister Joan, who was nine years younger than I was, must have been about two or three, and there was a guy on \\nthe radio called Uncle Don that she liked to listen to. He\\'d sing little songs about \"good children,\" and so on, and he\\'d read cards sent in by parents \\ntelling that \"Mary So -and-so is having a birthday this Saturday at 25 Flatbush Avenue.\" \\nOne day my cousin Francis and I sat Joan down and said that there was a special program she should listen to. Then we ran upstairs and we \\nstarted to broadcast: \"This is Uncle Don. We know a very nice little girl named Joan who lives on New Broadway; she\\'s got a birthday coming--not \\ntoday, but such-and-such. She\\'s a cute girl.\" We sang a little so ng, and then we made music: \"Deedle leet deet, doodle doodle loot doot; deedle deedle \\nleet, doodle loot doot doo We went through the whole deal, and then we came downstairs: \"How was it? Did you like the program?\" \\n\"It was good,\" she said, \"but why did you make the music with your mouth?\" \\nOne day I got a telephone call: \"Mister, are you Richard Feynman ?\" \\n\"Yes.\" \\n\"This is a hotel. We have a radio that doesn\\'t work, and would like it repaired. We understand you might be able to do something about it.\" \\n\"But I\\'m only a little boy,\" I said. \"I don\\'t know how--\" \\n\"Yes, we know that, but we\\'d like you to come over anyway.\" \\nIt was a hotel that my aunt was running, but I didn\\'t know that. I went over there with--they still tell the story--a big screwdriver in my back \\npocket. Well, I was small, so any screwdriver looked big in my back pocket. \\nI went up to the radio and tried to fix it. I didn\\'t know anything about it, but there was also a handyman at the hotel, and either he noticed, or I \\nnoticed, a loose knob on the rheostat--to turn up the volume--so that it wasn\\'t turning the shaft. He went off and filed something, and fixed it up so it \\nworked. \\nThe next radio I tried to fix didn\\'t work at all. That was easy: it wasn\\'t plugged in right. As the repair jobs got more and more complicated, I got \\nbetter and better, and more elaborate. I bought myself a milliammeter in New York and converted it into a voltmeter that had different scales on it by \\nusing the right lengths (which I calculated) of very fine copper wire. It wasn\\'t very accurate, hut it was good enough to tell whether things were in the \\nright ballpark at different connections in those radio sets.  \\nThe main reason people hired me was the Depression. They didn\\'t have any money to fix their radios, and they\\'d hear about t his kid who would \\ndo it for less. So I\\'d climb on roofs to fix antennas, and all kinds of stuff. I got a series of lessons of ever-increasing difficulty. Ultimately I got some \\njob like converting a DC set into an AC set, and it was very hard to keep the hum from going through the system, and I didn\\'t build it quite right. I \\nshouldn\\'t have bitten that one off, but I didn\\'t know. \\nOne job was really sensational. I was working at the time for a printer, and a man who knew that printer knew I was trying to get jobs fixing \\nradios, so he sent a fellow around to the print shop to pick me up. The guy is obviously poor--his car is a complete wreck--and we go to his house \\nwhich is in a cheap part of town. On the way, I say, \"What\\'s the trouble with the radio?\" \\nHe says, \"When I turn it on it makes a noise, and after a while the noise stops and everything\\'s all right, but I don\\'t like the noise at the \\nbeginning.\" \\nI think to myself: \"What the hell! If he hasn\\'t got any money, you\\'d think he could stand a little noise for a while.\" \\nAnd all the time, on the way to his house, he\\'s saying things like, \"Do you know anything about radios? How do you know about radios--you\\'re \\njust a little boy!\" \\nHe\\'s putting me down the whole way, and I\\'m thinking, \"So what\\'s the matter with him? So it makes a little noise.\" \\nBut when we got there I went over to the radio and turned it on. Little noise? My God! No wonder the poor guy couldn\\'t stand it. The thing began \\nto roar and wobble--WUH BUH BUH BUH BUH--A tremendous amount of noise. Then it quieted down and played correctly. So I started to think: \\n\"How can that happen?\" \\nI start walking back and forth, thinking, and I realize that one way it can happen is that the tubes are heating up in the wrong order--that is, the \\namplifier\\'s all hot, the tubes are ready to go, and there\\'s nothing feeding in, or there\\'s some back circuit feeding in, or something wrong in the \\nbeginning part --the HF part--and therefore it\\'s making a lot of noise, picking up something. And when the RF circuit\\'s finally going, and the grid \\nvoltages are adjusted, everything\\'s all right. \\nSo the guy says, \"What are you doing? You come to fix the radio, but you\\'re only walking back and forth!\" \\nI say, \"I\\'m thinking!\" Then I said to myself, \"All right, take the tubes out, and reverse the order completely in the set.\" (Many radio sets in those \\ndays used the same tubes in different places--212\\'s, I think they were, or 212-A\\'s.) So I changed the tubes around, stepped to the front of the radio, \\nturned the thing on, and it\\'s as quiet as a lamb: it waits until it heats up, and then plays perfectly --no noise. \\nWhen a person has been negative to you, and then you do something like that, they\\'re usually a hundred percent the other way, kind of to \\ncompensate. He got me other jobs, and kept telling everybody what a tremendous genius I was, saying, \"He fixes radios by thinking!\" The whole idea \\nof thinking, to fix a radio--a little boy stops and thinks, and figures out how to do it--he never thought that was possible. \\nRadio circuits were much easier to understand in those days because everything was out in the open. After you took the set apart (it was a big \\nproblem to find the right screws), you could see this was a resistor, that\\'s a condenser, here\\'s a this, there\\'s a that; they were all labeled. And if wax \\nhad been dripping from the condenser, it was too hot and you could tell that the condenser was burned out. If there was charcoal on one of the \\nresistors you knew where the trouble was. Or, if you couldn\\'t tell what was the matter by looking at it, you\\'d test it with your voltmeter and see \\nwhether voltage was coming through. The sets were simple, the circuits were not complicated. The voltage on the grids was always about one and a'),\n",

That particular time it happened to be a friend of my mother, so I had time-there was nobody on my back saying, \"What are you doing?\" \\nInstead, they were saying, \"Would you like a little milk, or some cake?\" I finally fixed it because I had, and still have, persistence. Once I get on a \\npuzzle, I can\\'t get off. If my mother\\'s friend had said, \"Never mind, it\\'s too much work,\" I\\'d have blown my top, because I want to beat this damn \\nthing, as long as I\\'ve gone this far. I can\\'t just leave it after I\\'ve found out so much about it. I have to keep going to find out ult imately what is the \\nmatter with it in the end. \\nThat\\'s a puzzle drive. It\\'s what accounts for my wanting to decipher Mayan hieroglyphics, for trying to open safes. I remember in high school, \\nduring first period a guy would come to me with a puzzle in geomet ry, or something which had been assigned in his advanced math class. I wouldn\\'t \\nstop until I figured the damn thing out--it would take me fifteen or twenty minutes. But during the day, other guys would come to me with the same \\nproblem, and I\\'d do it for them in a flash. So for one guy, to do it took me twenty minutes, while there were five guys who thought I was a super-\\ngenius. \\nSo I got a fancy reputation. During high school every puzzle that was known to man must have come to me. Every damn, crazy conundrum that \\npeople had invented, I knew. So when I got to MIT there was a dance, and one of the seniors had his girlfriend there, and she knew a lot of puzzles, \\nand he was telling her that I was pretty good at them. So during the dance she came over to me and said, \"They say you\\'re a smart guy, so here\\'s one \\nfor you: A man has eight cords of wood to chop . . .\" \\nAnd I said, \"He starts by chopping every other one in three parts,\" because I had heard that one. \\nThen she\\'d go away and come back with another one, and I\\'d always know it. \\nThis went on for quite a while, and finally, near the end of the dance, she came over, looking as if she was going to get me for sure this time, and \\nshe said, \"A mother and daughter are traveling to Europe . . .\" \\n\"The daughter got the bubonic plague.\" \\nShe collapsed! That was hardly enough clues to get the answer to that one: It was the long story about how a mother and daughter stop at a hotel \\nand stay in separate rooms, and the next day the mother goes to the daughter\\'s room and there\\'s nobody there, or somebody else is there, and she says, \\n\"Where\\'s my daughter?\" and the hotel keeper says, \"What daughter?\" and the register\\'s got only the mother\\'s name, and so on, and so on, and there\\'s a \\nbig mystery as to what happened. The answer is, the daughter got bubonic plague, and the hotel, not wanting to have to close up, spirits the daughter \\naway, cleans up the room, and erases all evidence of her having been there. It was a long tale, but I had heard it, so when the girl started out with, \"A \\nmother and daughter are traveling to Europe,\" I knew one thing that started that way, so I took a flying guess, and got it. \\nWe had a thing at high school called the algebra team, which consisted of five kids, and we would travel to different schools as a team and have \\ncompetitions. We would sit in one row of seats and the other team would sit in another row. A teacher, who was running the contest, would take out \\nan envelope, and on the envelope it says \"forty-five seconds.\" She opens it up, writes the problem on the blackboard, and says, \"Go!\"--so you really \\nhave more than forty-five seconds because while she\\'s writing you can think. Now the game was this: You have a piece of paper, and on it you can \\nwrite anything, you can do anything. The only thing that counted was the answer. If the answer was \"six books,\" you\\'d have to write \"6,\" and put a \\nbig circle around it. If what was in the circle was right, you won; if it wasn\\'t, you lost. \\nOne thing was for sure: It was practically impossible to do the problem in any conventional, straightforward way, like putting \"A is the number \\nof red books, B is the number of blue books,\" grind, grind, grind, until you get \"six books.\" That would take you fifty seconds, because the people \\nwho set up the timings on these problems had made them all a trifle short. So you had to think, \"Is there a way to see it?\" Sometimes you could see it \\nin a flash, and sometimes you\\'d have to invent another way to do it and then do the algebra as fast as you could. It was wonderful practice, and I got \\nbetter and better, and I eventually got to be the head of the team. So I learned to do algebra very quickly, and it came in handy in college. When we \\nhad a problem in calculus, I was very quick to see where it was going and to do the algebra--fast. \\nAnother thing I did in high school was to invent problems and theorems. I mean, if I were doing any mathematical thing at all, I would find some \\npractical example for which it would be useful. I invented a set of right-triangle problems. But instead of givin g the lengths of two of the sides to find \\nthe third, I gave the difference of the two sides. A typical example was: There\\'s a flagpole, and there\\'s a rope that comes down from the top. When \\nyou hold the rope straight down, it\\'s three feet longer than the pole, and when you pull the rope out tight, it\\'s five feet from the base of the pole. How \\nhigh is the pole? \\nI developed some equations for solving problems like that, and as a result I noticed some connection--perhaps it was sin2 + cos2 = 1--that \\nreminded me of trigonometry. Now, a few years earlier, perhaps when I was eleven or twelve, I had read a book on trigonometry that I had checked \\nout from the library, but the book was by now long gone. I remembered only that trigonometry had something to do with relations between sines and \\ncosines. So I began to work out all the relations by drawing triangles, and each one I proved by myself. I also calculated the sine, cosine, and tangent \\nof every five degrees, starting with the sine of five degrees as given, by addition and half-angle formulas that I had worked out. \\nA few years later, when we studied trigonometry in school, I still had my notes and I saw that my demonstrations were often different from those \\nin the book. Sometimes, for a thing where I didn\\'t notice a simple way to do it, I went all over the place till I got it. Other times, my way was most \\nclever--the standard demonstration in the book was much more complicated! So sometimes I had \\'em heat, and sometimes it was the other way \\naround. \\nWhile I was doing all this trigonometry, I didn\\'t like the symbols for sine, cosine, tangent, and so on. To me, \"sin f\" looked like s times i times n \\ntimes f! So I invented another symbol, like a square root sign, that was a sigma with a long arm sticking out of it, and I put the f underneath. For the \\ntangent it was a tau with the top of the tau extended, and for the cosine I made a kind of gamma, but it looked a little bit like the square root sign. \\nNow the inverse sine was the same sigma, but left -to-right reflected so that it started with the horizontal line with the value underneath, and then \\nthe sigma. That was the inverse sine, NOT sink f--that was crazy! They had that in books! To me, sin_i meant i/sine, the reciprocal. So my symbols \\nwere better.'),\n",

I don\\'t know how much I got--twenty-two dollars \\na month, I think--and I alternated eleven hours one day and thirteen the next as a desk clerk or as a busboy in the restaurant. And during the afternoon, \\nwhen you were desk clerk, you had to bring milk up to Mrs. D--, an invalid woman who never gave us a tip. That\\'s the way the world was: You \\nworked long hours and got nothing for it, every day. \\nThis was a resort hotel, by the beach, on the outskirts of New York City. The husbands would go to work in the city and leave the wives behind \\nto play cards, so you would always have to get the bridge tables out. Then at night the guys would play poker, so you\\'d get the tables ready for them--\\nclean out the ashtrays and so on. I was always up until late at night, like two o\\'clock, so it really was thirteen and eleven hours a day. \\nThere were certain things I didn\\'t like, such as tipping. I thought we should be paid more, and not have to have any tips. But when I proposed that \\nto the boss, I got nothing but laughter. She told everybody, \"Richard doesn\\'t want his tips, hee, hee, hee; he doesn\\'t want his tips, ha, ha, ha.\" The \\nworld is full of this kind of dumb smart -alec who doesn\\'t understand anything. \\nAnyway, at one stage there was a group of men who, when they\\'d come back from working in the city, would right away want ice for their drinks. \\nNow the other guy working with me had really been a desk clerk. He was older than I was, and a lot more professional. One time he said to me, \\n\"Listen, we\\'re always bringing ice up to that guy Ungar and he never gives us a tip --not even ten cents. Next time, when they ask for ice, just don\\'t do \\na damn thing. Then they\\'ll call you back, and when they call you back, you say, \\'Oh, I\\'m sorry. I forgot. We\\'re all forgetful sometimes.\\'\" \\nSo I did it, and Ungar gave me fifteen cents! But now, when I think back on it, I realize that the other desk clerk, the professional, had really \\nknown what to do--tell the other guy to take the risk of getting into trouble. He put me to the job of training this fella to give tips. He never said \\nanything; he made me do it! \\nI had to clean up tables in the dining room as a busboy. You pile all this stuff from the tables on to a tray at the side, and when it gets high \\nenough you carry it into the kitchen. So you get a new tray, right? You should do it in two steps--take the old tray away, and put in a new one-but I \\nthought, \"I\\'m going to do it in one step.\" So I tried to slide the new tray under, and pull the old tray out at the same time, and it slipped--BANG! All \\nthe stuff went on the floor. And then, naturally, the question was, \"What were you doing? How did it fall?\" Well, how could I explain that I was \\ntrying to invent a new way to handle trays? \\nAmong the desserts there was some kind of coffee cake that came out very pretty on a doily, on a little plate. But if you would go in the back \\nyou\\'d see a man called the pantry man. His problem was to get the stuff ready for desserts. Now this man must have been a miner, or something--\\nheavy built, with very stubby, rounded, thick fingers. He\\'d take this stack of doilies, which are manufactured by some sort of stamping process, all \\nstuck together, and he\\'d take these stubby fingers and try to separate the doilies to put them on the plates. I always heard him say, \"Damn deez \\ndoilies!\" while he was doing this, and I remember thinking, \"What a contrast--the person sitting at the table gets this nice cake on a doilied plate, \\nwhile the pantry man back there with the stubby thumbs is saying, \\'Damn deez doilies!\\'\" So that was the difference between the real world and what it \\nlooked like. \\nMy first day on the job the pantry lady explained that she usually made a ham sandwich, or something, for the guy who was on the late shift. I \\nsaid that I liked desserts, so if there was a dessert left over from supper, I\\'d like that. The next night I was on the late shift till 2:00 A.M. with these \\nguys playing poker. I was sitting around with nothing to do, getting bored, when suddenly I remembered there was a dessert to eat. I went over to the \\nicebox and opened it up, and there she\\'d left six desserts! There was a chocolate pudding, a piece of cake, some peach slices, some rice pudding, \\nsome jello --there was everything! So I sat there and ate the six desserts--it was sensational! \\nThe next day she said to me, \"I left a dessert for you. \\n\"It was wonderful,\" I said, \"absolutely  wonderful!\" \\n\"But I left you six desserts because I didn\\'t know which one you liked the best.\" \\nSo from that time on she left six desserts. They weren\\'t always different, but there were always six desserts. \\nOne time when I was desk clerk a girl left a book by the telephone at the desk while she went to eat dinner, so I looked at. it. It was The Life of \\nLeonardo, and I couldn\\'t resist: The girl let me borrow it and I read the whole thing. \\nI slept in a little room in the back of the hotel, and there was some stew about turning out the lights when you leave your room, which I couldn\\'t \\never remember to do. Inspired by the Leonardo book, I made this gadget which consisted of a system of strings and weights--Coke bottles full of \\nwater-- that would operate when I\\'d open the door, lighting the pull-chain light inside. You open the door, and things would go, and light the light; \\nthen you close the door behind you, and the light would go out. But my real accomplishment came later. \\nI used to cut vegetables in the kitchen. String beans had to be cut into one-inch pieces. The way you were supposed to do it was: You hold two \\nbeans in one hand, the knife in the other, and you press the knife against the beans and your thumb, almost cutting yourself. It was a slow process. So \\nI put my mind to it, and I got a pretty good idea. I sat down at the wooden table outside the kitchen, put a bowl in my lap, and stuck a very sharp \\nknife into the table at a forty-five-degree angle away from me. Then I put a pile of the string beans on each side, and I\\'d pick out a bean, one in each \\nhand, and bring it towards me with enough speed that it would slice, and the pieces would slide into the bowl that was in my lap. \\nSo I\\'m slicing beans one after the other--chig, chig, chig, chig, chig--and everybody\\'s giving me the beans, and I\\'m going like sixty when the boss \\ncomes by and says, \"What are you doing?\" \\nI say, \"Look at the way I have of cutting beans!\"--and just at that moment I put a finger through instead of a bean. Blood came out and went on \\nthe beans, and there was a big excitement: \"Look at how many beans you spoiled! What a stupid way to do things!\" and so on. So I was never able to \\nmake any improvement, which would have been easy--with a guard, or something--but no, there was no chance for improvement. \\nI had another invention, which had a similar difficulty. We had to slice potatoes after t hey\\'d been cooked, for some kind of potato salad. They \\nwere sticky and wet, and difficult to handle. I thought of a whole lot of knives, parallel in a rack, coming down and slicing the whole thing. I thought \\nabout this a long time, and finally I got the idea of wires in a rack,'),\n",

The next time the \\npotatoes came out I got my little egg-slicer out and sliced all the potatoes in no time, and sent them back to the chef. The chef was a German, a great \\nbig guy who was King of the Kitchen, and he came storming out, blood vessels sticking out of his neck, livid red. \"What\\'s the matter with the \\npotatoes?\" he says. \"They\\'re not sliced!\" \\nI had them sliced, but they were all stuck together. He says, \"How can I separate them?\" \\n\"Stick \\'em in water,\" I suggest. \\n\"IN WATER? EAGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\" \\nAnother time I had a really good idea. When I was desk clerk I had to answer the telephone. When a call came in, somet hing buzzed, and a flap \\ncame down on the switchboard so you could tell which line it was. Sometimes, when I was helping the women with the bridge tables or sitting on the \\nfront porch in the middle of the afternoon (when there were very few calls), I\\'d be some distance from the switchboard when suddenly it would go. I\\'d \\ncome running to catch it, but the way the desk was made, in order to get to the switchboard you had to go quite a distance further down, then around, \\nin behind, and then back up to see where the call was coming from--it took extra time. \\nSo I got a good idea. I tied threads to the flaps on the switchboard, and strung them over the top of the desk and then down, and at the end of \\neach thread I tied a little piece of paper. Then I put the telephone talking piece up on top of the desk, so I could reach it from the front. Now, when a \\ncall came, I could tell which flap was down by which piece of paper was up, so I could answer the phone appropriately, from the front, to save time. \\nOf course I still had to go around back to switch it in, but at least I was answering it. I\\'d say, \"Just a moment,\" and then go around to switch it in. \\nI thought that was perfect, but the boss came by one day, and she wanted to answer the phone, and she couldn\\'t figure it out--too complicated. \\n\"What are all these papers doing? Why is the telephone on this side? Why don\\'t you . . . raaaaaaaa!\" \\nI tried to explain--it was my own aunt--that there was no reason not to do that, but you can\\'t say that to anybody who\\'s smart, who runs a hotel! I \\nlearned there that innovation is a very difficult thing in the real world.'),\n",

In those days, if you were Jewish or brought up in a Jewish \\nfamily, you didn\\'t have a chance in any other fraternity. Nobody else would look at you. I wasn\\'t particularly looking to be with other Jews, and the \\nguys from the Phi Beta Delta fraternity didn\\'t care how Jewish I was--in fact, I didn\\'t believe anything about that stuff, and was certainly not in any \\nway religious. Anyway, some guys from the fraternity asked me some questions and gave me a little bit of advice--that I ought to take the first-year \\ncalculus exam so I wouldn\\'t have to take the course-which turned out to be good advice. I liked the fellas who came down to New York from the \\nfraternity, and the two guys who talked me into it, I later became their roommate. \\nThere was another Jewish fraternity at MIT, called \"SAM,\" and their idea was to give me a ride up to Boston and I could stay with them. I \\naccepted the ride, and stayed upstairs in one of the rooms that first night. \\nThe next morning I looked out the window and saw the two guys from the other fraternity (that I met in New York) walking up the steps. Some \\nguys from the Sigma Alpha Mu ran out to talk to them and there was a big discussion. \\nI yelled out the window, \"Hey, I\\'m supposed to be with those guys!\" and I rushed out of the fraternity without realizing that they were all \\noperating, competing for my pledge. I didn\\'t have any feelings of gratitude for the ride, or anything. \\nThe Phi Beta Delta fraternity had almost collapsed the year before, because there were two different cliques that had split the fraternity in half. \\nThere was a group of socialite characters, who liked to have dances and fool around in their cars afterwards, and so on, and there was a group of guys \\nwho did nothing but study, and never went to the dances. \\nJust before I came to the fraternity they had had a big meeting and had made an important compromise. They were going to get together and help \\neach other out. Everyone had to have a grade level of at least such-and-such. If they were sliding behind, the guys who studied all the time would \\nteach them and help them do their work. On the other side, everybody had to go to every dance. If a guy didn\\'t know how to get a date, the other guys \\nwould get him a date. If the guy didn\\'t know how to dance, they\\'d teach him to dance. One group was teaching the other how to think, while the other \\nguys were teaching them how to be social. \\nThat was just right for me, because I was not very good socially. I was so timid that when I had to take the mail out and walk past some seniors \\nsitting on the steps with some girls, I was petrified: I didn\\'t know how to walk past them! And it didn\\'t help any when a girl would say, \"Oh, he\\'s \\ncute!\" \\nIt was only a little while after that the sophomores brought their girlfriends and their girlfriends\\' friends over to teach us to dance. Much later, \\none of the guys taught me how to drive his car. They worked very hard to get us intellectual characters to socialize and be more relaxed, and vice \\nversa. It was a good balancing out. \\nI had some difficulty understanding what exactly it meant to be \"social.\" Soon after these social guys had taught me how to meet girls, I saw a \\nnice waitress in a restaurant where I was eating by myself one day. With great effort I finally got up enough nerve to ask her to be my date at the next \\nfraternity dance, and she said yes.  \\nBack at the fraternity, when we were talking about the dates for the next dance, I told the guys I didn\\'t need a date this time--I had found one on \\nmy own. I was very proud of myself. \\nWhen the upperclassmen found out my date was a waitress, they were horrified. They told me that was not possible; they would get me a \\n\"proper\" date. They made me feel as though I had strayed, that I was amiss. They decided to take over the situation. They went to the restaurant, \\nfound the waitress, talked her out of it, and got me another girl. They were trying to educate their \"wayward son,\" so to speak, but they were wrong, I \\nthink. I was only a freshman then, and I didn\\'t have enough confidence yet to stop them from breaking my date. \\nWhen I became a pledge they had various ways of hazing. One of the things they did was to take us, blindfolded, far out into the countryside in \\nthe dead of winter and leave us by a frozen lake about a hundred feet apart. We were in the middle of absolutely nowhere--no houses, no nothing--\\nand we were supposed to find our way back to the fraternity. We were a little bit scared, because we were young, and we didn\\'t say much--except for \\none guy, whose name was Maurice Meyer: you couldn\\'t stop him from joking around, making dumb puns, and having this happy-go-lucky attitude of \\n\"Ha, ha, there\\'s nothing to worry about. Isn\\'t this fun!\" \\nWe were getting mad at Maurice. He was always walking a little bit behind and laughing at the whole situation, while the rest of us didn\\'t know \\nhow we were ever going to get out of this. \\nWe came to an intersection not far from the lake--there were still no houses or anything--and the rest of us were discussing whether we should go \\nthis way or that way, when Maurice caught up to us and said, \"Go this way.\" \\n\"What the hell do you know, Maurice?\" we said, frustrated. \"You\\'re always making these jokes. Why should we go this way?\" \\n\"Simple: Look at the telephone lines. Where there\\'s more wires, it\\'s going toward the central station.\" \\nThis guy, who looked like he wasn\\'t paying attention to anything, had come up with a terrific idea! We walked straight into town without making \\nan error. \\nOn the following day there was going to be a school wide freshman versus sophomore mudeo (various forms of wrestling and tug of wars that \\ntake place in the mud). Late in the evening, into our fraternity comes a whole bunch of sophomores--some from our fraternity and some from outside-\\n- and they kidnap us: they want us to be tired the next day so they can win. \\nThe sophomores tied up all the freshmen relatively easily--except me. I didn\\'t want the guys in the fraternity to find out that I was a \"sissy.\" (I \\nwas never any good in sports. I was always terrified if a tennis ball would come over the fence and land near me, because I never could get it over the \\nfence-it usually went about a radian off of where it was supposed to go.) I figured this was a new situation, a new world, and I could make a new \\nreputation. So in order that I wouldn\\'t look like I didn\\'t know how to fight, I fought like a son of a gun as best I could (not knowing what I was doing),'),\n",

I remember distinctly one young man \\nthey were afraid to tie down because he was so terrified: his face was pale yellow green and he was shaking.

The \\ncommander grabbed my head and turned it, shouting, \"Straighten up!\" \\nI winced, as my shoulders went at an angle: \"I can\\'t help it, sir! \\n\"Oh, excuse me!\" he said, apologetically. \\nAnyway, the fact that I fought so long and hard not to be tied up gave me a terrific reputation, and I never had to worry about that  sissy business \\nagain--a tremendous relief. \\nI often listened to my roommates--they were both seniors--studying for their theoretical physics course. One day they were working pretty hard \\non something that seemed pretty clear to me, so I said, \"Why don\\'t you use the Bernoulli’s equation?\" \\n\"What\\'s that!\" they exclaimed. \"What are you talking about!\" \\nI explained to them what I meant and how it worked in this case, and it solved the problem. It turned out it was Bernoulli\\'s equation that I meant, \\nbut I had read all this stuff in the encyclopedia without talking to anybody about it, so I didn\\'t know how to pronounce anything. \\nBut my roommates were very excited, and from then on they discussed their physics problems with me--I wasn\\'t so lucky with many of them--\\nand the next year, when I took the course, I advanced rapidly. That was a very good way to get educated, working on the senior problems and \\nlearning how to pronounce things. \\nI liked to go to a place called the Raymor and Playmore Ballroom--two ballrooms that  were connected together--on Tuesday nights. My \\nfraternity brothers didn\\'t go to these \"open\" dances; they preferred their own dances, where the girls they brought were upper crust ones they had met \\n\"properly.\" I didn\\'t care, when I met somebody, where they were from, or what their background was, so I would go to these dances--even though my \\nfraternity brothers disapproved (I was a junior by this time, and they couldn\\'t stop me)--and I had a very good time. \\nOne time I danced with a certain girl a few times, and didn\\'t say much. Finally, she said to me, \"Who hants vewwy nice-ee.\" \\nI couldn\\'t quite make it out--she had some difficulty in speech--but I thought she said, \"You dance very nicely.\" \\n\"Thank you,\" I said. \"It\\'s been an honor.\" \\nWe went over to a table where a friend of hers had found a boy she was dancing with and we sat, the four of us, together. One girl was very hard \\nof hearing, and the other girl was nearly deaf. \\nWhen the two girls conversed they would do a large amount of signaling very rapidly back and forth, and grunt a little bit. It didn\\'t bother me; \\nthe girl danced well, and she was a nice person. \\nAfter a few more dances, we\\'re sitting at the table again, and there\\'s a large amount of signaling back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, \\nuntil finally she says something to me which I gathered means, she\\'d like us to take them to some hotel. \\nI ask the other guy if he wants to go. \\n\"What do they want us to go to this hotel for?\" he asks.  \\n\"Hell, I don\\'t know. We didn\\'t talk well enough!\" But I don\\'t have to know. It\\'s just fun, seeing what\\'s going to happen; it\\'s an adventure! \\nThe other guy\\'s afraid, so he says no. So I take the two girls in a taxi to the hotel, and discover that there\\'s a dance organized by the deaf and \\ndumb, believe it or not. They all belonged to a club. It turns out many of them can feel the rhythm enough to dance to the music and applaud the band \\nat the end of each number. \\nIt was very, very interesting! I felt as if I was in a foreign country and couldn\\'t speak the language: I could speak, but nobody could hear me. \\nEverybody was talking with signs to everybody else, and I couldn\\'t understand anything! I asked my girl to teach me some signs and I learned a few, \\nlike you learn a foreign language, just for fun. \\nEveryone was so happy and relaxed with each other, making jokes and smiling all the time; they didn\\'t seem to have any real difficulty of any \\nkind communicating with each other. It was the same as with any other language, except for one thing: as they\\'re making signs to each other, their \\nheads were always turning from one side to the other. I realized what that was. When someone wants to make a side remark or interrupt you, he can\\'t \\nyell, \"Hey, Jack!\" He can only make a signal, which you won\\'t catch unless you\\'re in the habit of looking around all the time. \\nThey were completely comfortable with each other. It was my problem to be comfortable. It was a wonderful experience.'),\n",

They were all orderin g things by pointing to them. I \\nremember somebody asking in signs, \"Where-are-you-from?\" and my girl spelling out \"N-e-w Y-o-r-k.\" I still remember a guy signing to me \"Good \\nsport!\"--he holds his thumb up, and then touches an imaginary lapel, for \"sport.\" It\\'s a nice system. \\nEverybody was sitting around, making jokes, and getting me into their world very nicely. I wanted to buy a bottle of milk, so I went up to the \\nguy at the counter and mouthed the word \"milk\" without saying anything. \\nThe guy didn\\'t understand. \\nI made the symbol for \"milk,\" which is two fists moving as if you\\'re milking a cow, and he didn\\'t catch that either. \\nI tried to point to the sign that showed the price of milk, but he still didn\\'t catch on. \\nFinally, some stranger nearby ordered milk, and I pointed to it. \\n\"Oh! Milk!\" he said, as I nodded my head yes. \\nHe handed me the bottle, and I said, \"Thank you very much!\" \\n\"You SON of a GUN!\" he said, smiling. \\nI often liked to play tricks on people when I was at MIT. One time, in mechanical drawing class, some joker picked up a French curve (a piece of \\nplastic for drawing smooth curves--a curly, funny-looking thing) and said, \"I wonder if the curves on this thing have some special formula?\" \\nI thought for a moment and said, \"Sure they do. The curves are very special curves. Lemme show ya,\" and I picked up my French curve and \\nbegan to turn it slowly. \"The French curve is made so that at the lowest point on each curve, no matter how you turn it, the tangent is horizontal.\" \\nAll the guys in the class were holding their French curve up at different angles, holding their pencil up to it at the lowest point and laying it along, \\nand discovering that, sure enough, the tangent is horizontal. They were all excited by t his \"discovery\"--even though they had already gone through a \\ncertain amount of calculus and had already \"learned\" that the derivative (tangent) of the minimum (lowest point) of any curve is zero (horizontal). \\nThey didn\\'t put two and two together. They didn\\'t even know what they \"knew.\" \\nI don\\'t know what\\'s the matter with people: they don\\'t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way--by rote, or something. Their \\nknowledge is so fragile! \\nI did the same kind of trick four years later at Princeton when I was talking with an experienced character, an assistant of Einstein, who was \\nsurely working with gravity all the time. I gave him a problem: You blast off in a rocket which has a clock on board, and there\\'s a clock on the \\nground. The idea is that you have to be back when the clock on the ground says one hour has passed. Now you want it so that when you come back, \\nyour clock is as far ahead as possible. According to Einstein, if you go very high, your clock will go faster, because the higher something is in a \\ngravitational field, the faster its clock goes. But if you try to go too high, since you\\'ve only got an hour, you have to go so fast to get there that the \\nspeed slows your clock down. So you can\\'t go too high. The question is, exactly what program of speed and height should you make so that you get \\nthe maximum time on your clock? \\nThis assistant of Einstein worked on it for quite a bit before he realized that the answer is the real motion of matter. If you shoot something up in \\na normal way, so that the time it takes the shell to go up and come down is an hour, that\\'s the correct motion. It\\'s the fundamental principle of \\nEinstein\\'s gravity--that is, what\\'s called the \"proper time\" is at a maximum for the actual curve. But when I put it to him, about a rocket with a clock, \\nhe didn\\'t recognize it. It was just like the guys in mechanical drawing class, but this time it wasn\\'t dumb freshmen. So this kind of fragility is, in fact, \\nfairly common, even with more learned people. \\nWhen I was a junior or senior I used to eat at a certain restaurant in Boston. I went there by myself, often on successive evenings. People got to \\nknow me, and I had the same waitress all the time. \\nI noticed that they were always in a hurry, rushing around, so one day, just for fun, I left my tip, which was usually ten cents (normal for those \\ndays), in two nickels, under two glasses: I filled each glass to the very top, dropped a nickel in, and with a card over it, turned it over so it was upside \\ndown on the table. Then I slipped out the card (no water leaks out because no air can come in --the rim is too close to the table for that). \\nI put the tip under two glasses because I knew they were always in a hurry. If the tip was a dime in one glass, the waitress, in her haste to get the \\ntable ready for the next customer, would pick up the glass, the water would spill out, and that would be the end of it. But after she does that with the \\nfirst glass, what the hell is she going to do with the second one? She can\\'t just have the nerve to lift it up now! \\nOn the way out I said to my waitress, \"Be careful, Sue. There\\'s something funny about the glasses you gave me-- they\\'re filled in on the top, and \\nthere\\'s a hole on the bottom!\" \\nThe next day I came back, and I had a new waitress. My regular waitress wouldn\\'t have anything to do with me. \"Sue\\'s very angry at you,\" my \\nnew waitress said. \"After she picked up the first glass and water went all over the place, she called the boss out. They studied it a little bit, but they \\ncouldn\\'t spend all day figuring out what to do, so they finally picked up the other one, and water went out again, all over the floor. It was a terrible \\nmess; Sue slipped later in the water. They\\'re all mad at you.\" \\nI laughed. \\nShe said, \"It\\'s not funny! How would you like it if someone did t hat to you--what would you do?\" \\n\"I\\'d get a soup plate and then slide the glass very carefully over to the edge of the table, and let the water run into the soup plate--it doesn\\'t have \\nto run onto the floor. Then I\\'d take the nickel out.\" \\n\"Oh, that\\'s a goood idea,\" she said. \\nThat evening I left my tip under a coffee cup, which I left upside down on the table.'),\n",

One morning I woke up very early, about five o\\'clock, and couldn\\'t go back to sleep, so I \\nwent downstairs from the sleeping rooms and discovered some signs hanging on strings which said things like \"DOOR! DOOR! WHO STOLE THE \\nDOOR?\" I saw that someone had taken a door off its hinges, and in its place they hung a sign that said, \"PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR!\"--the sign \\nthat used to be on the door that was missing. \\nI immediately figured out what the idea was. In that room a guy named Pete Bernays and a couple of other guys liked to work very hard, and \\nalways wanted it quiet. If you wandered into their room looking for something, or to ask them how they did problem such and such, when you would \\nleave you would always hear these guys scream, \"Please close the door!\" \\nSomebody had gotten tired of this, no doubt, and had taken the door off. Now this room, it so happened, had two doors, the way it was built, so I \\ngot an idea: I took the other door off its hinges, carried it downstairs, and hid it in the basement behind the oil tank. Then I quietly went back upstairs \\nand went to bed. \\nLater in the morning I made believe I woke up and came downstairs a little late. The other guys were milling around, and Pete and his friends \\nwere all upset: The doors to their room were missing, and they had to study, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was coming down the stairs and they said, \\n\"Feynman! Did you take the doors?\" \\n\"Oh, yeah!\" I said. \"I took the door. You can see the scratches on my knuckles here, that I got when my hands scraped against the wall as I was \\ncarrying it down into the basement.\" \\nThey weren\\'t satisfied with my answer; in fact, they didn\\'t believe me. \\nThe guys who took the first door had left so many clues--the handwriting on the signs, for instance--that they were soon found out. My idea was \\nthat when it was found out who stole the first door, everybody would think they also stole the other door. It worked perfectly: The guys who took the \\nfirst door were pummeled and tortured and worked on by everybody, until finally, with much pain and difficulty, they convinced their tormentors that \\nthey had only taken one door, unbelievable as it might be. \\nI listened to all this, and I was happy. \\nThe other door stayed missing for a whole week, and it became more and more important to the guys who were trying to study in that room that \\nthe other door be found. \\nFinally, in order to solve the problem, the president of the fraternity says at the dinner table, \"We have to solve this problem of t he other door. I \\nhaven\\'t been able to solve the problem myself, so I would like suggestions from the rest of you as to how to straighten this out, because Pete and the \\nothers are trying to study.\" \\nSomebody makes a suggestion, then someone else. \\nAfter a little while, I get up and make a suggestion. \"All right,\" I say in a sarcastic voice, \"whoever you are who stole the door, we know you\\'re \\nwonderful. You\\'re so clever! We can\\'t figure out who you are, so you must be some sort of super-genius. You don\\'t have t o tell us who you are; all we \\nwant to know is where the door is. So if you will leave a note somewhere, telling us where the door is, we will honor you and admit forever that you \\nare a super-marvel, that you are so smart that you could take the other door without our being able to figure out who you are. But for God\\'s sake, just \\nleave the note somewhere, and we will be forever grateful to you for it.\" \\nThe next guy makes his suggestion: \"I have another idea,\" he says. \"I think that you, as president, should ask each man on his word of honor \\ntowards the fraternity to say whether he took the door or not.\" \\nThe president says, \"That\\'s a very good idea. On the fraternity word of honor!\" So he goes around the table, and asks each guy, one by one: \"Jack, \\ndid you take the door?\" \\n\"No, sir, I did not take the door.\" \\n\"Tim: Did you take the door?\" \\n\"No, sir! I did not take the door!\" \\n\"Maurice. Did you take the door?\" \\n\"No, I did not take the door, sir.\" \\n\"Feynman, did you take the door?\" \\n\"Yeah, I took the door.\" \\n\"Cut it out, Feynman; this is serious! Sam! Did you take the door . . .\" --it went all the way around. Everyone was shocked. There must be some \\nreal rat in the fraternity who didn\\'t respect the fraternity word of honor! \\nThat night I left a note with a little picture of the oil tank and the door next to it, and the next day they found the door and put it back.'),\n",

I LOVed the ROLLing SOUNds going over me, as \\nif I was in the ocean, and the waves weren\\'t very high. I used to sit there and have the water come over me, in this BEAUtiful iTALian. In the Italian \\nprograms there was always some kind of family situation where there were discussions and arguments between the mother and father: High voice: \\n\"Nio teco TIEto capeto TUtto  . . .\" \\nLoud, low voice: \"DRO tone pala TUtto!!\" (with hand slapping). \\nIt was great! So I learned to make all these emotions: I could cry; I could laugh; all this stuff. Italian is a lovely language. \\nThere were a number of Italian people living near us in New York. Once while I was riding my bicycle, some Italian truck driver got upset at me, \\nleaned out of his truck, and, gesturing, yelled something like, \"Me aRRUcha LAMpe etta Tiche!\" \\nI felt like a crapper. What did he say to me? What should I yell back? \\nSo I asked an Italian friend of mine at school, and he said, \"Just say, \\'A te! A te!\\'--which means \\'The same to you! The same to you!\" \\nI thought it was a great idea. I would say \\'A te! A te!\" back--gesturing, of course. Then, as I gained confidence, I developed my abilities further. I \\nwould be riding my bicycle, and some lady would be driving in her car and get in the way, and I\\'d say, \"PUzzia a la maLOche!\"--and she\\'d shrink! \\nSome terrible Italian boy had cursed a terrible curse at her! \\nIt was not so easy to recognize it as fake Italian. Once, when I was at Princeton, as I was going into the parking lot at Palmer Laboratory on my \\nbicycle, somebody got in the way. \\nMy habit was always the same: I gesture to the guy, \"oREzze caB ONca MIche!\", slapping the back of one hand against the other. \\nAnd way up on the other side of a long area of grass, there\\'s an Italian gardener putting in some plants. He stops, waves, and shouts happily, \\n\"REzza ma LIa!\" \\nI call back, \"RONte BALta!\", returning the greeting. He didn\\'t know I didn\\'t know, and I didn\\'t know what he said, and he didn\\'t know what I \\nsaid. But it was OK! It was great! It works! After all, when they hear the intonation, they recognize it immediately as Italian--maybe it\\'s Milano \\ninstead of Romano, what the hell. But he\\'s an iTALian! So it\\'s just great. But you have to have absolute confidence. Keep right on going, and nothing \\nwill happen. \\nOne time I came home from college for a vacation, and my sister was sort of unhappy, almost crying: her Girl Scouts were having a father-\\ndaughter banquet, but our father was out on the road, selling uniforms. So I said I would take her, being the brother (I\\'m nine years older, so it wasn\\'t \\nso crazy). \\nWhen we got there, I sat among the fathers for a while, but soon became sick of them. All these fathers bring their daughters to this nice little \\nbanquet, and all they talked about was the stock market--they don\\'t know how to talk to their own children, much less their children\\'s friends. \\nDuring the banquet the girls entertained us by doing little skits, reciting poetry, and so on. Then all of a sudden they bring out this funny-looking \\napron like thing, with a hole at the top to put your head through. The girls announce that the fathers are now going to entertain them. \\nSo each father has to get up and stick his head through and say something--one guy recites \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\"--and they don\\'t know what \\nto do. I didn\\'t know what to do either, but by the time I got up there, I told them that I was going to recite a little poem, and I\\'m sorry that it\\'s not in \\nEnglish, but I\\'m sure they will appreciate it anyway: \\nA TUZZO LANTO \\nPoici di Pare \\nTANto SAca TULna TI, na PUta TUchi PUti TI la. \\nRUNto CAta CHANto CHANta MANto CHI la TI da. \\nYALta CAra SULda MI la CHAta Picha Pino Tito \\nBRALda pe te CHIna nana CHUNda lala CHINda lala CHUNda! \\nRONto piti CA le, a TANto CHINto quinta LALda \\nola TiNta dalla LALta, YENta PUcha lalla TALta! \\nI do this for three or four stanzas, going through all the emotions that I heard on Italian radio, and the kids are unraveled, rolling in the aisles, \\nlaughing with happiness. \\nAfter the banquet was over, the scoutmaster and a schoolteacher came over and told me they had been discussing my poem. One of them thought \\nit was Italian, and the other thought it was Latin.

But at MIT there was a rule: You have to take \\nsome humanities courses to get more \"culture.\" Besides the English classes required were two electives, so I looked through the list, and right away I \\nfound astronomy--as a humanities course! So that year I escaped with astronomy. Then next year I looked further down the list, past French literature \\nand courses like that, and found philosophy. It was the closest thing to science I could find. \\nBefore I tell you what happened in philosophy, let me tell you about the English class. We had to write a number of themes. For instance, Mill \\nhad written something on liberty, and we had to criticize it. But instead of addressing myself to political liberty, as Mill did, I wrote about liberty in \\nsocial occasions--the problem of having to fake and lie in order to be polite, and does this perpetual game of faking in social situations lead to the \\n\"destruction of the moral fiber of society.\" An interesting question, but not the one we were supposed to discuss. \\nAnother essay we had to criticize was by Huxley, \"On a Piece of Chalk,\" in which he describes how an ordinary piece of chalk he is holding is \\nthe remains from animal bones, and the forces inside the earth lifted it up so that it became part of the White Cliffs, and then it was quarried and is \\nnow used to conve ideas through writing on the blackboard. \\nBut again, instead of criticizing the essay assigned to us, I wrote a parody called, \"On a Piece of Dust,\" about how dust makes the colors of the \\nsunset and precipitates the rain, and so on. I was always a faker, always trying to escape. \\nBut when we had to write a theme on Goethe\\'s Faust, it was hopeless! The work was too long to make a parody of it or to invent something else. \\nI was storming back and forth in the fraternity saying, \"I can\\'t do it. I\\'m just not gonna do it. I ain\\'t gonna do it!\" \\nOne of my fraternity brothers said, \"OK, Feynman, you\\'re not gonna do it. But the professor will think you didn\\'t do it because you don\\'t want to \\ndo the work. You oughta write a theme on something--same number of words--and hand it in with a note saying that you just couldn\\'t understand the \\nFaust, you haven\\'t got the heart for it, and that it\\'s impossible for you to writ e a theme on it.\" \\nSo I did that. I wrote a long theme, \"On the Limitations of Reason.\" I had thought about scientific techniques for solving problems, and how \\nthere are certain limitations: moral values cannot be decided by scientific methods, yak, yak, yak, and so on. \\nThen another fraternity brother offered some more advice. \"Feynman,\" he said, \"it ain\\'t gonna work, handing in a theme that\\'s got nothing to do \\nwith Faust. What you oughta do is work that thing you wrote into the Faust.\" \\n\"Ridiculous!\" I said. \\nBut the other fraternity guys think it\\'s a good idea. \\n\"All right, all right!\" I say, protesting. \"I\\'ll try.\" \\nSo I added half a page to what 1 had already written, and said that Mephistopheles represents reason, and Faust represents the spirit, and Goethe \\nis trying to show the limitations of reason. I stirred it up, cranked it all in, and handed in my theme. \\nThe professor had us each come in individually to discuss our theme. I went in expecting the worst. \\nHe said, \"The introductory material is fine, but the Faust material is a bit too brief. Otherwise, it\\'s very good-- B + .\" I escaped again! \\nNow to the philosophy class. The course was taught by an old bearded professor named Robinson, who always mumbled. I would go to the class, \\nand he would mumble along, and I couldn\\'t understand a thing. The other people in the class seemed to understand him better, but they didn\\'t seem to \\npay any attention. I happened to have a small drill, about one-sixteenth-inch, and to pass the time in that class, I would twist it between my fingers \\nand drill holes in the sole of my shoe, week after week. \\nFinally one day at the end of the class, Professor Robinson went \"wugga mugga mugga wugga wugga . . . and everybody got excited! They were \\nall talking to each other and discussing, so I figured he\\'d said something interesting, thank God! I wondered what it was? \\nI asked somebody, and they said, \"We have to write a theme, and hand it in in four weeks.\" \\n\"A theme on what?\" \\n\"On what he\\'s been talking about all year.\" \\nI was stuck. The only thing that I had heard during that entire term that I could remember was a moment when there came this upwelling, \\n\"muggawuggastreamofconsciousnessmugga wugga,\" and phoom!--it sank back into chaos. \\nThis \"stream of consciousness\" reminded me of a problem my father had given to me many years before. He said, \"Suppose some Martians were \\nto come down to earth, and Martians never slept, but instead were perpetually active. Suppose they didn\\'t have this crazy phenomenon that we have, \\ncalled sleep. So they ask you the question: \\'How does it  feel to go to sleep? What happens when you go to sleep? Do your thoughts suddenly stop, or \\ndo they move less aanndd lleeessss rraaaaapppppiidddddllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy yyy? How does the mind actually turn off?\" \\nI got interested. Now I had to answer this question: How does the stream of consciousness end, when you go to sleep? \\nSo every afternoon for the next four weeks I would work on my theme, I would pull down the shades in my room, turn off the lights, and go to \\nsleep. And I\\'d watch what happened, when I went to sleep. \\nThen at night, I\\'d go to sleep again, so I had two times each day when I could make observations--it was very good! \\nAt first I noticed a lot of subsidiary things that had little to do with falling asleep. I noticed, for instance, that I did a lot of thinking by speaking \\nto myself internally. I could also imagine things visually. \\nThen, when I was getting tired, I noticed that I could think of two things at once.

I wasn\\'t aware that I was imagining these ropes until I began to worry that one rope would catch on \\nthe other rope, and they wouldn\\'t wind up smoothly. But I said, internally, \"Oh, the tension will take care of that,\" and this interrupted the first \\nthought I was having, and made me aware that I was thinking of t wo things at once. \\nI also noticed that as you go to sleep the ideas continue, but they become less and less logically interconnected. You don\\'t notice that they\\'re not \\nlogically connected until you ask yourself, \"What made me think of that?\" and you try to work your way back, and often you can\\'t remember what \\nthe hell did make you think of that! \\nSo you get every illusion of logical connection, but the actual fact is that the thoughts become more and more cockeyed until they\\'re completely \\ndisjointed, and beyond that, you fall asleep. \\nAfter four weeks of sleeping all the time, I wrote my theme, and explained the observations I had made. At the end of the theme I pointed out \\nthat all of these observations were made while I was watching myself fall asleep, and I don\\'t really know what it\\'s like to fall asleep when I\\'m not \\nwatching myself. I concluded the theme with a little verse I made up, which pointed out this problem of introspection: \\nI wonder why. I wonder why. \\nI wonder why I wonder. \\nI wonder why I wonder why \\nI wonder why I wonder! \\nWe hand in our themes, and the next time our class meets, the professor reads one of them: \"Mum bum wugga mum bum . . .\" I can\\'t tell what \\nthe guy wrote. \\nHe reads another theme: \"Mugga wugga mum bum wugga wugga. . .\" I don\\'t know what that guy wrote either, but at the end of it, he goes: \\nUh wugga wuh. Uh wugga wuh \\nUh wugga wugga wugga. \\nI wugga wuh uh wugga wuh \\nUh wugga wugga wugga. \\n\"Aha!\" I say. \"That\\'s my theme!\" I honestly didn\\'t recognize it until the end. \\nAfter I had written the theme I continued to be curious, and I kept practicing this watching myself as I went to sleep. One night, while I was \\nhaving a dream, I realized I was observing myself in the dream. I had gotten all the way down into the sleep itself! \\nIn the first part of the dream I\\'m on top of a train and we\\'re approaching a tunnel. I get scared, pull myself down, and we go into the tunnel--\\nwhoosh! I say to myself, \"So you can get the feeling of fear, and you can hear the sound change when you go into the tunnel.\" \\nI also noticed that I could see colors. Some people had said that you dream in black and white, but no, I was dreaming in color. \\nBy this time I was inside one of the train cars, and I can feel the train lurching about. I say to myself, \"So you can get kinesthetic feelings in a \\ndream.\" I walk with some difficulty down to the end of the car, and I see a big window, like a store window. Behind it there are-not mannequins, but \\nthree live girls in bathing suits, and they look pretty good! \\nI continue walking into the next car, hanging onto the straps overhead as I go, when I say to myself, \"Hey! It would be interesting to get excited--\\nsexually--so I think I\\'ll go back into the other car.\" I discovered that I could turn around, and walk back through the t rain--I could control the \\ndirection of my dream. I get back to the car with the special window, and I see three old guys playing violins--but they turned back into girls! So I \\ncould modify the direction of my dream, but not perfectly. \\nWell, I began to get excited, intellectually as well as sexually, saying things like, \"Wow! It\\'s working!\" and I woke up. \\nI made some other observations while dreaming. Apart from always asking myself, \"Am I really dreaming in color?\" I wondered, \"How \\naccurately do you see something?\" \\nThe next time I had a dream, there was a girl lying in tall grass, and she had red hair. I tried to see if I could see each hair. You know how there\\'s \\na little area of color just where the sun is reflecting--the diffraction effect, I could see that! I could see each hair as sharp as you want: perfect vision! \\nAnother time I had a dream in which a thumbtack was stuck in a doorframe. I see the tack, run my fingers down the doorframe, and I feel the \\ntack. So the \"seeing department\" and the \"feeling department\" of the brain seem to be connected. Then I say to myself, Could it be that they don\\'t \\nhave to be connected? I look at the doorframe again, and there\\'s no thumbtack. I run my finger down the doorframe, and I feel the tack! \\nAnother time I\\'m dreaming and I hear \"knock-knock; knock-knock.\" Something was happening in the dream that made this knocking fit, but not \\nperfectly--it seemed sort of foreign. I thought: \"Absolutely guaranteed that this knocking is coming from outside my dream, and I\\'ve invented this \\npart of the dream to fit with it. I\\'ve got to wake up and find out what the hell it is.\" \\nThe knocking is still going, I wake up, and . . . Dead silence. There was nothing. So it wasn\\'t connected to the outside. \\nOther people have told me that they have incorporated external noises into their dreams, but when I had this experience, carefully \"watching \\nfrom below,\" and sure the noise was coming from outside the dream, it wasn\\'t. \\nDuring the time of making observations in my dreams, the process of waking up was a rather fearful one. As you\\'re beginning to wake up there\\'s \\na moment when you feel rigid and tied down, or underneath many layers of cotton batting. It\\'s hard to explain, but there\\'s a moment when you get the \\nfeeling you can\\'t get out; you\\'re not sure you can wake up. So I would have to tell myself--after I was awake--that that\\'s ridiculous. There\\'s no disease \\nI know of where a person falls asleep naturally and can\\'t wake up. You can always wake up. And after talking to myself many times like that, I'),\n",

I answer for the twenty-fifth time, \"Yes, I\\'m \\ndreaming in color,\" and then I realize that I\\'ve been sleeping with the back of my head against a brass rod. I put my hand behind my head and I feel \\nthat the back of my head is soft. I think, \"Aha! That\\'s why I\\'ve been able to make all these observations in my dreams: the brass rod has disturbed my \\nvisual cortex. All I have to do is sleep with a brass rod under my head, and I can make these observations any time I want. So I think I\\'ll stop making \\nobservations on this one, and go into deeper sleep.\" \\nWhen I woke up later, there was no brass rod, nor was the back of my head soft. Somehow I had become tired of making these observations, and \\nmy brain had invented some false reasons as to why I shouldn\\'t do it any more. \\nAs a result of these observations I began to get a little theory. One of the reasons that I liked to look at dreams was that I was curious as to how \\nyou can see an image, of a person, for example, when your eyes are closed, and nothing\\'s coming in. You say it might be random, irregular nerve \\ndischarges, but you can\\'t get the nerves to discharge in exactly the same delicate patterns when you are sleeping as when you are awake, looking at \\nsomething. Well then, how could I \"see\" in color, and in better detail, when I was asleep? \\nI decided there must be an \"interpretation department.\" When you are actually looking at something--a man, a lamp, or a wall--you don\\'t just see \\nblotches of color. Something tells you what it is; it has to be interpreted. When you\\'re dreaming, this interpretation department is still operating, but \\nit\\'s all slopped up. It\\'s telling you that you\\'re seeing a human hair in the greatest detail, when it isn\\'t true. It\\'s interpreting the random junk entering the \\nbrain as a clear image. \\nOne other thing about dreams. I had a friend named Deutsch, whose wife was from a family of psychoanalysts in Vienna. One evening, during a \\nlong discussion about dreams, he told me that dreams have significance: there are symbols in dreams that can be interpreted psychoanalytically. I \\ndidn\\'t believe most of this stuff, but that night I had an interesting dream: We\\'re playing a game on a billiard table with three balls--a white ball, a \\ngreen ball, and a gray ball--and the name of the game is \"titsies.\" There was something about trying to get the balls into the pocket: the white ball and \\nthe green ball are easy to sink into the pocket, but the gray one, I can\\'t get to it. \\nI wake up, and the dream is very easy to interpret: the name of the game gives it away, of course-them\\'s girls! The white ball was easy to figure \\nout, because I was going out, sneakily, with a married woman who worked at the time as a cashier in a cafeteria and wore a white uniform. The green \\none was also easy, because I had gone out about two nights before to a drive-in movie with a girl in a green dress. But the gray one-what the hell was \\nthe gray one? I knew it had to be somebody; I felt it. It\\'s like when you\\'re trying to remember a name, and it\\'s on the tip of your tongue, hut you can\\'t \\nget it. \\nIt took me half a day before I remembered that I had said goodbye to a girl I liked very much, who had gone to Italy about two or three months \\nbefore. She was a very nice girl, and I had decided that when she came back I was going to see her again. I don\\'t know if she wore a gray suit, but it \\nwas perfectly clear, as soon as I thought of her, that she was the gray one. \\nI went back to my friend Deutsch, and I told him he must be right--there is something to analyzing dreams. But when he heard about my \\ninteresting dream, he said, \"No, that one was too perfect--too cut and dried. Usually you have to do a bit more analysis.\"'),\n",

I had applied two or three times to the Bell Labs, and had gone out a few times to visit. Bill \\nShockley, who knew me from the lab at MIT, would show me around each time, and I enjoyed those visits terrifically, but I never got a job there. \\nI had letters from some of my professors to two specific companies. One was to the Bausch and Lomb Company for tracing rays through lenses; \\nthe other was to Electrical Testing Labs in New York. At that time nobody knew what a physicist even was, and there weren\\'t any positions in \\nindustry for physicists. Engineers, OK; but physicists--nobody knew how to use them. It\\'s interesting that very soon, after the war, it was the exact \\nopposite: people wanted physicists everywhere. So I wasn\\'t getting anywhere as a physicist looking for a job late in the Depression. \\nAbout that time I met an old friend of mine on the beach at our home town of Far Rockaway, where we grew up together. We had gone to school \\ntogether when we were about eleven or twelve, and were very good friends. We were both scientifically minded. He had a \"laboratory,\" and I had a \\n\"laboratory.\" We often played together, and discussed things together. \\nWe used to put on magic shows--chemistry magic--for the kids on the block. My friend was a pretty good showman, and I kind of liked that too. \\nWe did our tricks on a little t able, with Bunsen burners at each end going all the time. On the burners we had watch glass plates (flat glass discs) with \\niodine on them, which made a beautiful purple vapor that went up on each side of the table while the show went on. It was great! We did a lot of \\ntricks, such as turning \"wine\" into water, and other chemical color changes. For our finale, we did a trick that used something which we had \\ndiscovered. I would put my hands (secretly) first into a sink of water, and then into benzine. Then I would \"accidentally\" brush by one of the Bunsen \\nburners, and one hand would light up. I\\'d clap my hands, and both hands would then be burning. (It doesn\\'t hurt because it burns fast and the water \\nkeeps it cool.) Then I\\'d wave my hands, running around yellin g, \"FIRE! FIRE!\" and everybody would get all excited. They\\'d run out of the room, and \\nthat was the end of the show! \\nLater on I told this story at college to my fraternity brothers and they said, \"Nonsense! You can\\'t do that!\" \\n(I often had this problem of demonstrating to these fellas something that they didn\\'t believe-like the time we got into an argument as to whether \\nurine just ran out of you by gravity, and I had to demonstrate that that wasn\\'t the case by showing them that you can pee standing on your head. Or \\nthe time when somebody claimed that if you took aspirin and Coca-Cola you\\'d fall over in a dead faint directly. I told them I thought it was a lot of \\nbaloney, and offered to take aspirin and Coca-Cola together. Then they got into an argument whether you should have the aspirin before the Coke, \\njust after the Coke, or mixed in the Coke. So I had six aspirin and three Cokes, one right after the other. First, I took aspirins and then a Coke, then \\nwe dissolved two aspirins in a Coke and I took that, and then I took a Coke and two aspirins. Each time the idiots who believed it were standing \\naround me, waiting to catch me when I fainted. But nothing happened. I do remember that I didn\\'t sleep very well that night, so I got up and did a lot \\nof figuring, and worked out some of the formulas for what is called the Riemann-Zeta function.) \\n\"All right, guys,\" I said. \"Let\\'s go out and get some benzine.\" \\nThey got the benzine ready, I stuck my hand in the water in the sink and then into the benzine and lit it . . . and it hurt like hell! You see, in the \\nmeantime I had grown hairs on the back of my hand, which acted like wicks and held the benzine in place while it burned, whereas when I had done \\nit earlier I had no hairs on the back of my hand. After I did the experiment for my fraternity brothers, I didn\\'t have any hairs on the back of my hands \\neither. \\nWell, my pal and I met on the beach, and he told me that he had a process for metal-plating plastics. I said that was impossible, because there\\'s \\nno conductivity; you can\\'t attach a wire. But he said he could metal-plate anything, and I still remember him picking up a peach pit that was in the \\nsand, and saying he could metal-plate that --trying to impress me. \\nWhat was nice was that he offered me a job at his little company, which was on the top floor of a building in New York. There were only about \\nfour people in the company. His father was the one who was getting the money together and was, I think, the \"president.\" He was the \"vice-\\npresident,\" along with another fella who was a salesman. I was the \"chief research chemist,\" and my friend\\'s brother, who was not very clever, was \\nthe bottle-washer. We had six metal-plating baths. \\nThey had this process for metal-plating plastics, and the scheme was: First, deposit silver on t he object by precipitating silver from a silver \\nnitrate bath with a reducing agent (like you make mirrors); then stick the object, with silver on it as a conductor, into an electroplating bath, and the \\nsilver gets plated. \\nThe problem was, does the silver stick to the object? \\nIt doesn\\'t. It peels off easily. So there was a step in between, to make the silver stick better to the object. It depended on the material. For things \\nlike Bakelite, which was an important plastic in those days, my friend had found that if he sandblasted it first, and then soaked it for many hours in \\nstannous hydroxide, which got into the pores of the Bakelite, the silver would hold onto the surface very nicely. \\nBut it worked only on a few plastics, and new kinds of plastics were coming out all the time, such as methyl methacrylate (which we call \\nplexiglass, now), that we couldn\\'t plate directly, at first. And cellulose acetate, which was very cheap, was another one we couldn\\'t plate at first, \\nthough we finally discovered that putting it  in sodium hydroxide for a little while before using the stannous chloride made it plate very well. \\nI was pretty successful as a \"chemist\" in the company. My advantage was that my pal had done no chemistry at all; he had done no experiments; \\nhe just knew how to do something once. I set to work putting lots of different knobs in bottles, and putting all kinds of chemicals in. By trying \\neverything and keeping track of everything I found ways of plating a wider range of plastics than he had done before. \\nI was also able to simplify his process. From looking in books I changed the reducing agent from glucose to formaldehyde, and was able to \\nrecover 100 percent of the silver immediately, instead of having to recover the silver left in solution at a later time. \\nI also got the stannous hydroxide to dissolve in water by adding a little bit of hydrochloric acid--something I remembered from a college \\nchemistry course--so a step that used to take hours now took about five minutes.'),\n",

I\\'d have \\nall these bottles lined up, with everything marked, when all of a sudden, \"You gotta stop the experiment to do a \\'super job\\' for the sales department!\" \\nSo, a lot of experiments had to be started more than once. \\nOne time we got into one hell of a lot of trouble. There was some artist who was trying to make a picture for the cover of a magazine about \\nautomobiles. He had very carefully built a wheel out of plastic, and somehow or other this salesman had told him we could plate anything, so the \\nartist wanted us to metal-plate the hub, so it would be a shiny, silver hub. The wheel was made of a new plastic that we didn\\'t know very well how to \\nplate--the fact is, the salesman never knew what we could plate, so he was always promising things--and it didn\\'t work the first time. So, to fix it up \\nwe had to get the old silver off, and we couldn\\'t get it off easily. I decided to use concentrated nitric acid on it, which took the silver off all right, but \\nalso made pits and holes in the plastic. We were really in hot water that time! In fact, we had lots of \"hot water\" experiments. \\nThe other fellas in the company decided we should run advertisements in Modern Plastics magazine. A few things we metal-plated were very \\npretty. They looked good in the advertisements. We also had a few things out in a showcase in front, for prospective customers to look at, but nobody \\ncould pick up the things in the advertisements or in the showcase to see how well the plating stayed on. Perhaps some of them were, in fact, pretty \\ngood jobs. But they were made specially; they were not regular products. \\nRight after I left the company at the end of the summer to go to Princeton, they got a good offer from somebody who wanted to metal-plate \\nplastic pens. Now people could have silver pens that were light, and easy, and cheap. The pens immediately sold, all over, and it was rather exciting \\nto see people walking around everywhere with these pens--and you knew where they came from. \\nBut the company hadn\\'t had much experience with the material--or perhaps with the filler that was used in the plastic (most plastics aren\\'t pure; \\nthey have a \"filler,\" which in those days wasn\\'t very well controlled)--and the darn things would develop a blister. When you have something in your \\nhand that has a little blister that starts to peel, you can\\'t help fiddling with it. So everybody was fiddling with all the peelings coming off the pens.  \\nNow the company had this emergency problem to fix the pens, and my pal decided he needed a big microscope, and so on. He didn\\'t know what \\nhe was going to look at, or why, and it cost his company a lot of money for this fake research. The result was, they had trouble: They never solved the \\nproblem, and the company failed, because their first big job was such a failure. \\nA few years later I was in Los Alamos, where there was a man named Frederic de Hoffman, who was a sort of scientist; but more, he was also \\nvery good at administrating. Not highly trained, he liked mathematics, and worked very hard; he compensated for his lack of training by hard work. \\nLater he became the president or vice president of General Atomics and he was a big industrial character after that. But at the time he was just a very \\nenergetic, open-eyed, enthusiastic boy, helping along with the Project as best he could. \\nOne day we were eating at the Fuller Lodge, and he told me he had been working in England before coming to Los Alamos. \\n\"What kind of work were you doing there?\" I asked. \\n\"I was working on a process for metal-plating plastics. I was one of the guys in the laboratory.\" \\n\"How did it go?\" \\n\"It was going along pretty well, but we had our problems.\" \\n\"Oh?\" \\n\"Just as we were beginning to develop our process, there was a company in New York . . .\" \\n\"What company in New York?\" \\n\"It was called the Metaplast Corporation. They were developing further than we were.\" \\n\"How could you tell?\" \\n\"They were advertising all the time in Modern Plastics with full-page advertisements showing all the things they could plate, and we realized \\nthat they were further along than we were.\" \\n\"Did you have any stuff from them?\" \\n\"No, but you could tell from the advertisements that they were way ahead of what we could do. Our process was pretty good, but it was no use \\ntrying to compete with an American process like that.\" \\n\"How many chemists did you have working in the lab?\" \\n\"We had six chemists working.\" \\n\"How many chemists do you think the Metaplast Corporation had?\" \\n\"Oh! They must have had a real chemistry department!\" \\n\"Would you describe for me what you think the chief research chemist at the Metaplast Corporation might look like, and how his laboratory \\nmight work?\" \\n\"I would guess they must have twenty-five or fifty chemists, and the chief research chemist has his own office--special, with glass.

I thought it was a great place, and I wanted to go to graduate school there too, of course. But \\nwhen I went to Professor Slater and told him of my intentions, he said, \"We won\\'t let you in here.\" \\nI said, \"What?\" \\nSlater said, \"Why do you think you should go to graduate school at MIT?\" \\n\"Because MIT is the best school for science in the country.\" \\n\"You think that?\" \\n\"Yeah.\" \\n\"That \\'s why you should go to some other school. You should find out how the rest of the world is.\" \\nSo I decided to go to Princeton. Now Princeton had a certain aspect of elegance. It was an imitation of an English school, partly. So the guys in \\nthe fraternity, who knew my rather rough, informal manners, started making remarks like \"Wait till they find out who they\\'ve got coming to \\nPrinceton! Wait till they see the mistake they made!\" So I decided to try to be nice when I got to Princeton. \\nMy father took me to Princeton in his car, and I got my room, and he left. I hadn\\'t been there an hour when I was met by a man: \"I\\'m the Mahstah \\nof Residences heah, and I should like to tell you that the Dean is having a Tea this aftanoon, and he should like to have all of you come. Perhaps you \\nwould be so kind as to inform your roommate, Mr. Serette.\" \\nThat was my introduction to the graduate \"College\" at Princeton, where all the students lived. It was like an imitation Oxford or Cambridge--\\ncomplete with accents (the master of residences was a professor of \"French littrachaw\"). There was a porter downstairs, everybody had nice rooms, \\nand we ate all our meals together, wearing academic gowns, in a great hall which had stained-glass windows. \\nSo the very afternoon I arrived in Princeton I\\'m going to the dean\\'s tea, and I didn\\'t even know what a \"tea\" was, or why! I had no social abilities \\nwhatsoever; I had no experience with this sort of thing. \\nSo I come up to the door, and there\\'s Dean Eisenhart, greeting the new students: \"Oh, you\\'re Mr. Feynman,\" he says. \"We\\'re glad to have you.\" \\nSo that helped a little, because he recognized me, somehow. \\nI go through the door, and there are some ladies, and some girls, too. It\\'s all very formal and I\\'m thinking about where to sit down and should I sit \\nnext to this girl, or not, and how should I behave, when I hear a voice behind me. \\n\"Would you like cream or lemon in your tea, Mr. Feynman?\" It\\'s Mrs. Eisenhart, pouring tea. \\n\"I\\'ll have both, thank you,\" I say, still looking for where I\\'m going to sit, when suddenly I hear \"Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Surely you\\'re joking, Mr. \\nFeynman.\" \\nJoking? Joking? What the hell did I just say? Then I realized what I had done. So that was my first experience with this tea business. \\nLater on, after I had been at Princeton longer, I got to understand this \"Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.\" In fact it was at that first tea, as I was leaving, that \\nI realized it meant \"You\\'re making a social error.\" Because the next time I heard this same cackle, \"Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh,\" from Mrs. Eisenhart, \\nsomebody was kissing her hand as he left. \\nAnother time, perhaps a year later, at another tea, I was talking to Professor Wildt, an astronomer who had worked out some theory about the \\nclouds on Venus. They were supposed to be formaldehyde (it\\'s wonderful t o know what we once worried about) and he had it all figured out, how the \\nformaldehyde was precipitating, and so on. It was extremely interesting. We were talking about all this stuff, when a little lady came up and said, \"Mr. \\nFeynman, Mrs. Eisenhart would like to see you.\" \\n\"OK, just a minute . . .\" and I kept talking to Wildt. \\nThe little lady came back again and said, \"Mr. Feynman, Mrs. Eisenhart would like to see you.\" \\n\"OK, OK!\" and I go over to Mrs. Eisenhart, who\\'s pouring tea. \\n\"Would you like to have some coffee or tea, Mr. Feynman?\" \\n\"Mrs. So-and-so says you wanted to talk to me.\" \\n\"Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh. Would you like to have coffee, or tea, Mr. Feynman?\" \\n\"Tea,\" I said, \"thank you.\" \\nA few moments later Mrs. Eisenhart\\'s daughter and a schoolmate came over, and we were introduced to each other. The whole idea of this \"heh-\\nheh-heh\" was: Mrs. Eisenhart didn\\'t want to talk to me, she wanted me over there getting tea when her daughter and friend came over, so they would \\nhave someone to talk to. That\\'s the way it worked.

You \\nnever cleaned the gown and you never repaired it, so the first-year men had very nice, relatively clean gowns, but by the time you got to the third \\nyear or so, it was nothing but some kind of cardboard thing on your sh oulders with tatters hanging down from it. \\nSo when I got to Princeton, I went to that tea on Sunday afternoon and had dinner that evening in an academic gown at the \"College.\" But on \\nMonday, the first thing I wanted to do was to see the cyclotron. \\nMIT had built a new cyclotron while I was a student there, and it was just beautiful! The cyclotron itself was in one room, with the controls in \\nanother room. It was beautifully engineered. The wires ran from the control room to the cyclotron underneath in conduit s, and there was a whole \\nconsole of buttons and meters. It was what I would call a gold-plated cyclotron. \\nNow I had read a lot of papers on cyclotron experiments, and there weren\\'t many from MIT. Maybe they were just starting. But there were lots of \\nresults from places like Cornell, and Berkeley, and above all, Princeton. Therefore what I really wanted to see, what I was looking forward to, was \\nthe PRINCETON CYCLOTRON. That must be something! \\nSo first thing on Monday, I go into the physics building and ask, \"Where is the cyclotron--which building?\" \\n\"It\\'s downstairs, in the basement--at the end of the hall.\" \\nIn the basement? It was an old building. There was no room in the basement for a cyclotron. I walked down to the end of the hall, went through \\nthe door, and in ten seconds I learned why Princeton was right for me--the best place for me to go to school. In this room there were wires strung all \\nover the place! Switches were hanging from the wires, cooling water was dripping from the valves, the room was full of stuff, all out in the open. \\nTables piled with tools were everywhere; it was the most godawful mess you ever saw. The whole cyclotron was there in one room, and it was \\ncomplete, absolute chaos! \\nIt reminded me of my lab at home. Nothing at MIT had ever reminded me of my lab at home. I suddenly realized why Princeton was getting \\nresults. They were working with the instrument. They built the instrument; they knew where everything was, they knew how everything worked, \\nthere was no engineer involved, except maybe he was working there too. It was much smaller than the cyclotron at MIT, and \"gold-plated\"?--it was \\nthe exact opposite. When they wanted to fix a vacuum, they\\'d drip glyptal on it, so there were drops of glyptal on the floor. It was wonderful! \\nBecause they worked with it. They didn\\'t have to sit in another room and push buttons! (Incidentally, they had a fire in that room, because of all the \\nchaotic mess that they had--too many wires--and it destroyed the cyclotron. But I\\'d better not tell about that!) \\n(When I got to Cornell I went to look at the cyclotron there. This cyclotron hardly required a room: It was about a yard across--the diameter of \\nthe whole thing. It was the world\\'s smallest cyclotron, hut they had got fantastic results. They had all kinds of special techniques and tricks. If they \\nwanted to change something in the \"D\\'s\"--the D-shaped half circles that the particles go around--they\\'d take a screwdriver, and remove the D\\'s by \\nhand, fix them, and put them back. At Princeton it was a lot harder, and at MIT you had to take a crane that came rolling across the ceiling, lower the \\nhooks, and it was a hellllll of a job.) \\nI learned a lot of different things from different schools. MIT is a very good place; I\\'m not trying to put it down. I was just in love with it. It has \\ndeveloped for itself a spirit, so that every member of the whole place thinks that it\\'s the most wonderful place in the world--it\\'s the center, somehow, \\nof scientific and technological development in the United States, if not the world. It\\'s like a New Yorker\\'s view of New York: they forget the rest of \\nthe country. And while you don\\'t get a good sense of proportion there, you do get an excellent sense of being with it and in it, and having motivation \\nand desire to keep on--that you\\'re specially chosen, and lucky to be there. \\nSo MIT was good, hut Slater was right to warn me to go to another school for my graduate work. And I often advise my students the same way. \\nLearn what the rest of the world is like. The variety is worthwhile. \\nI once did an experiment in the cyclotron laboratory at Princeton that had some startling results. There was a problem in a hydrodynamics book \\nthat was being discussed by all the physics students. The problem is this: You have an S-shaped lawn sprinkler--an S-shaped pipe on a pivot--and the \\nwater squirts out at right angles to the axis and makes it spin in a certain direction. Everybody knows which way it goes around; it backs away from \\nthe outgoing water. Now the question is this: If you had a lake, or swimming pool--a big supply of water--and you put the sprinkler completely under \\nwater, and sucked the water in, instead of squirting it out, which way would it turn? Would it turn the same way as it does when you squirt water out \\ninto the air, or would it turn the other way? \\nThe answer is perfectly clear at first sight. The trouble was, some guy would think it was perfectly clear one way, and another guy would think it \\nwas perfectly clear the other way. So everybody was discussing it. I remember at one particular seminar, or tea, somebody went nip to Prof John \\nWheeler and said, \"Which way do you think it goes around?\" \\nWheeler said, \"Yesterday, Feynman convinced me that it went backwards. Today, he\\'s convinced me equally well that it goes around the other \\nway. I don\\'t know what he\\'ll convince me of tomorrow!\" \\nI\\'ll tell you an argument that will make you think it\\'s one way, and another argument that will make you think it\\'s the other way, OK? \\nOne argument is that when you\\'re sucking water in, you\\'re sort of pulling the water with the nozzle, so it will go forward, towards the incoming \\nwater. \\nBut then another guy comes along and says, \"Suppose we hold it still and ask what kind of a torque we need to hold it still. In the case of the \\nwater going out, we all know you have to hold it on the outside of the curve, because of the centrifugal force of the water going around the curve, \\nNow, when the water goes around the same curve the other way, it still makes the same centrifugal force toward the outside of the curve. Therefore \\nthe two cases are the same, and the sprinkler will go around the same way, whether you\\'re squirting water out or sucking it in.\" \\nAfter some thought, I finally made up my mind what the answer was, and in order to demonstrate it, I wanted to do an experiment. \\nIn the Princeton cyclotron lab they had a big carboy--a monster bottle of water. I thought this was just great for the experiment. I got a piece of \\ncopper tubing and bent it into an S-shape. Then in the middle I drilled a hole, stuck in a piece of rubber hose, and led it up through a hole in a cork I \\nhad put in the top of the bottle. The cork had another hole, into which I put another piece of rubber hose, and connected it to the air pressure supply'),\n",

By blowing air into the bottle, I could force water into the copper tubing exactly as if I were sucking it in. Now, the S-shaped tubing \\nwouldn\\'t turn around, but it would twist (because of the flexible rubber hose), and I was going to measure the speed of the water flow by measuring \\nhow far it squirted out of the top of the bottle. \\nI got it all set up, turned on the air supply, and it went \"Puup!\" The air pressure blew the cork out of the bottle. I wired it in very well, so it \\nwouldn\\'t jump out. Now the experiment was going pretty good. The water was coming out, and the hose was twisting, so I put a little more pressure \\non it, because with a higher speed, the measurements would be more accurate. I measured the angle very carefully, and measured the distance, and \\nincreased the pressure again, and suddenly the whole thing just blew glass and water in all directions throughout the laboratory. A guy who had come \\nto watch got all wet and had to go home and change his clothes (it\\'s a miracle he didn\\'t get cut by the glass), and lots of cloud chamber pictures that \\nhad been taken patiently using the cyclotron were all wet, but for some reason I was far enough away, or in some such position that I didn\\'t get very \\nwet.

The speakers were often interesting, and in the \\ndiscussions after the talks we used to have a lot of fun. For instance, one guy in our school was very strongly anti-Catholic, so he passed out \\nquestions in advance for people to ask a religious speaker, and we gave the speaker a hard time. \\nAnother time somebody gave a talk about poetry. He talked about the structure of the poem and the emotions that come with it; he divided \\neverything up into certain kinds of classes. In the discussion that came afterwards, he said, \"Isn\\'t that the same as in mathematics, Dr. Eisenhart?\" \\nDr. Eisenhart was the dean of the graduate school and a great professor of mathematics. He was also very clever. He said, \"I\\'d like to know what \\nDick Feynman thinks about it in reference to theoretical physics.\" He was always putting me on in this kind of situation. \\nI got up and said, \"Yes, it\\'s very closely related. In theoretical physics, the analog of the word is the mathematical formula, the analog of the \\nstructure of the poem is the interrelationship of t he theoretical bling-bling with the so-andso\"--and I went through the whole thing, making a perfect \\nanalogy. The speaker\\'s eyes were beaming with happiness. \\nThen I said, \"It seems to me that no matter what you say about poetry, I could find a way of making up an analog with any subject, just as I did \\nfor theoretical physics. I don\\'t consider such analogs meaningful.\" \\nIn the great big dining hall with stained-glass windows, where we always ate, in our steadily deteriorating academic gowns, Dean Eisenhart \\nwould begin each dinner by saying grace in Latin. After dinner he would often get up and make some announcements. One night Dr. Eisenhart got up \\nand said, \"Two weeks from now, a professor of psychology is coming to give a talk about hypnosis. Now, this professor thought it would be much \\nbetter if we had a real demonstration of hypnosis instead of just talking about it. Therefore he would like some people to volunteer to be hypnotized. \\nI get all excited: There\\'s no question but that I\\'ve got to find out about hypnosis. This is going to he terrific! \\nDean Eisenhart went on to say that it would be good if three or four people would volunteer so that the hypnotist could try them out first to see \\nwhich ones would be able to be hypnotized, so he\\'d like to urge very much that we apply for this. (He\\'s wasting all this time, for God\\'s sake!) \\nEisenhart was down at one end of the hall, and I was way down at the other end, in the back. There were hundreds of guys there. I knew that \\neverybody was going to want to do this, and I was terrified that he wouldn\\'t see me because I was so far back. I just had to get in on this \\ndemonstration! \\nFinally Eisenhart said, \"And so I would like to ask if there are going to be any volunteers . . .\" \\nI raised my hand and shot out of my seat, screaming as loud as I could, to make sure that he would hear me: \"MEEEEEEEEEEE!\" \\nHe heard me all right, because there wasn\\'t another soul. My voice reverberated throughout the hall--it was very embarrassing. Eisenhart\\'s \\nimmediate reaction was, \"Yes, of course, I knew you would volunteer, Mr. Feynman, but I was wondering if there would be anybody else.\" \\nFinally a few other guys volunteered, and a week before the demonstration the man came to practice on us, to see if any of us would be good for \\nhypnosis. I knew about the phenomenon, but I didn\\'t know what it was like to be hypnotized. \\nHe started to work on me and soon I got into a position where he said, \"You can\\'t open your eyes.\" \\nI said to myself, \"I bet I could open my eyes, but I don\\'t want to disturb the situation: Let\\'s see how much further it goes.\" It was an interesting \\nsituation: You\\'re only slightly fogged out, and although you\\'ve lost a little bit, you\\'re pretty sure you could open your eyes. But of course, you\\'re not \\nopening your eyes, so in a sense you can\\'t do it. \\nHe went through a lot of stuff and decided that I was pretty good. \\nWhen the real demonstration came he had us walk on stage, and he hypnotized us in front of the whole Princeton Graduate College. This time \\nthe effect was stronger; I guess I had learned how to become hypnotized. The hypnotist made various demonstrations, having me do things that I \\ncouldn\\'t normally do, and at the end he said that after I came out of hypnosis, instead of returning to my seat directly, which was the natural way to \\ngo, I would walk all the way around the room and go to my seat from the back. \\nAll through the demonstration I was vaguely aware of what was going on, and cooperating with the things the hypnotist said, but this time I \\ndecided, \"Damn it, enough is enough! I\\'m gonna go straight to my seat.\" \\nWhen it was time to get up and go off the stage, I started to walk straight to my seat. But then an annoying feeling came over me: I felt so \\nuncomfortable that I couldn\\'t continue. I walked all the way around the hall. \\nI was hypnotized in another situation some time later by a woman. While I was hypnotized she said, \"I\\'m going to light a match, blow it out, and \\nimmediately touch the back of your hand with it. You will feel no pain.\" \\nI thought, \"Baloney!\" She took a match, lit it, blew it out, and touched it to the back of my hand. It felt slightly warm. My eyes were closed \\nthroughout all of this, but I was thinking, \"That\\'s easy. She lit one match, but touched a different match to my hand. There\\'s nothin\\' to that; it\\'s a \\nfake!\" \\nWhen I came out of the hypnosis and looked at the back of my hand, I got the biggest surprise: There was a burn on the back of my hand. Soon a \\nblister grew, and it never hurt at all, even when it broke. \\nSo I found hypnosis to be a very interesting experience. All the time you\\'re saying to yourself, \"I could do that, but I won\\'t\"--which is just \\nanother way of saying that you can\\'t.'),\n",

I sat with the physicists, but after a bit I thought: It \\nwould be nice to see what the rest of the world is doing, so I\\'ll sit for a week or two in each of the other groups. \\nWhen I sat with the philosophers I listened to them discuss very seriously a book called Process and Reality by Whitehead. They were using \\nwords in a funny way, and I couldn\\'t quite understand what they were saying. Now I didn\\'t want to interrupt them in their own conversation and keep \\nasking them to explain something, and on the few occasions that I did, they\\'d try to explain it to me, but I still didn\\'t get it. Finally they invited me to \\ncome to their seminar. \\nThey had a seminar that was like, a class. It had been meeting once a week to discuss a new chapter out of Process and Reality--some guy would \\ngive a report on it and then there would be a discussion. I went to this seminar promising myself to keep my mouth shut, reminding myself that I \\ndidn\\'t know anything about the subject, and I was going there just to watch. \\nWhat happened there was typical--so typical that it was unbelievable, but true. First of all, I sat there without saying anything, which is almost \\nunbelievable, but also true. A student gave a report on the chapter to be studied that week. In it Whitehead kept using the words \"essential object\" in a \\nparticular technical way that presumably he had defined, but that I didn\\'t understand. \\nAfter some discussion as to what \"essential object\" meant, the professor leading the seminar said something meant to clarify things and drew \\nsomething that looked like lightning bolts on the blackboard. \"Mr. Feynman,\" he said, \"would you say an electron is an \\'essential object\\'?\" \\nWell, now I was in trouble. I admitted that I hadn\\'t read the book, so I had no idea of what Whitehead meant by the phrase; I had only come to \\nwatch. \"But,\" I said, \"I\\'ll try to answer the professor\\'s question if you will first answer a question from me, so I can have a better idea of what \\n\\'essential object\\' means. Is a brick an essential object?\" \\nWhat I had intended to do was to find out whether they thought theoretical constructs were essential objects. The electron is a theory that we use; \\nit is so useful in understanding the way nature works that we can almost call it real. I wanted to make the idea of a theory clear by analogy. In the \\ncase of the brick, my next question was going to be, \"What about the inside of the brick?\"--and I would then point out that no one has ever seen the \\ninside of a brick. Every time you break the brick, you only see the surface. That the brick has an inside is a simple theory which helps us understand \\nthings better. The theory of electrons is analogous. So I began by asking, \"Is a brick an essential object?\" \\nThen the answers came out. One man stood up and said, \"A brick as an individual, specific brick. That is what Whitehead means by an essential \\nobject.\" \\nAnother man said, \"No, it isn\\'t the individual brick that is an essential object; it\\'s the general character that all bricks have in common--their \\n\\'brickiness\\'--that is the essential object.\" \\nAnother guy got up and said, \"No, it\\'s not in the bricks themselves. \\'Essential object\\' means the idea in the mind that you get when you think of \\nbricks.\" \\nAnother guy got up, and another, and I tell you I have never heard such ingenious different ways of looking at a brick before. And, just like it \\nshould in all stories about philosophers, it ended up in complete chaos. In all their previous discussions they hadn\\'t even asked themselves whether \\nsuch a simple object as a brick, much less an electron, is an \"essential object.\" \\nAfter that I went around to the biology table at dinner time. I had always had some interest in biology, and the guys talked about very interesting \\nthings. Some of them invited me to come to a course they were going to have in cell physiology. I knew something about biology, but this was a \\ngraduate course. \"Do you think I can handle it? Will the professor let me in?\" I asked. \\nThey asked the instructor, E. Newton Harvey, who had done a lot of research on light-producing bacteria. Harvey said I could join this special, \\nadvanced course provided one thing--that I would do all the work, and report on papers just like everybody else. \\nBefore the first class meeting, the guys who had invited me to take the course wanted to show me some things under the microscope. They had \\nsome plant cells in there, and you could see some little green spots called chloroplasts (they make sugar when light shines on them) circulating \\naround. I looked at them and then looked up: \"How do they circulate? What pushes them around?\" I asked. \\nNobody knew. It turned out that it was not understood at that time. So right away I found out something about biology: it was very easy to find a \\nquestion that was very interesting, and that nobody knew the answer to. In physics you had to go a little deeper before you could find an interesting \\nquestion that people didn\\'t know. \\nWhen the course began, Harvey started out by drawing a great, big picture of a cell on the blackboard and labeling all the things that are in a cell. \\nHe then talked about them, and I understood most of what he said. \\nAfter the lecture, the guy who had invited me said, \"Well, how did you like it?\" \\n\"Just fine,\" I said. \"The only part I didn\\'t understand was the part about lecithin. What is lecithin?\" \\nThe guy begins to explain in a monotonous voice: \"All living creatures, both plant and animal, are made of little bricklike objects called \\'cells\\'. \\n\"Listen,\" I said, impatiently, \"I know all that; otherwise I wouldn\\'t be in the course. What is lecithin?\" \\n\"I don\\'t know.\" \\nI had to report on papers along with everyone else, and the first one I was assigned was on the effect of pressure on cells--Harvey chose that \\ntopic for me because it had something that had to do with physics. Although I understood what I was doing, I mispronounced everything when I read \\nmy paper, and the class was always laughing hysterically when I\\'d talk about \"blastospheres\" instead of \"blastomeres,\" or some other such thing. \\nThe next paper selected for me was by Adrian and Bronk. They demonstrated that nerve impulses were sharp, single-pulse phenomena. They had \\ndone experiments with cats in which they had measured voltages on nerves.'),\n",

It kept talking about extensors and flexors, the gastrocnemius muscle, and so on. This and that muscle were named, but \\nI hadn\\'t the foggiest idea of where they were located in relation to the nerves or to the cat. So I went to the librarian in the biology section and asked \\nher if she could find me a map of the cat. \\n\"A map of the cat, sir?\" she asked, horrified. \"You mean a zoological chart!\" From then on there were rumors about some dumb biology graduate \\nstudent who was looking for a \"map of the cat.\" \\nWhen it came time for me to give my talk on the subject, I started off by drawing an outline of the cat and began to name the various muscles. \\nThe other students in the class interrupt me: \"We know all that!\" \\n\"Oh,\" I say, \"you do? Then no wonder I can catch up with you so fast after you\\'ve had four years of biology.\" They had wasted all their time \\nmemorizing stuff like that, when it could be looked up in fifteen minutes. \\nAfter the war, every summer I would go traveling by car somewhere in the United States. One year, after I was at Caltech, I thought, \"This \\nsummer, instead of going to a different place, I\\'ll go to a different field.\" \\nIt was right after Watson and Crick\\'s discovery of the DNA spiral. There were some very good biologists at Caltech because Delbrück had his \\nlab there, and Watson came to Caltech to give some lectures on the coding systems of DNA. I went to his lectures and to seminars in the biology \\ndepartment and got full of enthusiasm. It was a very exciting time in biology, and Caltech was a wonderful place to be. \\nI didn\\'t think I was up to doing actual research in biology, so for my summer visit to the field of biology I thought I would just hang around the \\nbiology lab and \"wash dishes,\" while I watched what they were doing. I went over to the biology lab to tell them my desire, and Bob Edgar, a young \\npost-doc who was sort of in charge there, said he wouldn\\'t let me do that. He said, \"You\\'ll have to really do some research, just like a graduate student, \\nand we\\'ll give you a problem to work on.\" That suited me fine. \\nI took a phage course, which told us how to do research with bacteriophages (a phage is a virus that contains DNA and attacks bacteria). Right \\naway I found that I was saved a lot of trouble because I knew some physics and mathematics. I knew how atoms worked in liquids, so there was \\nnothing mysterious about how the centrifuge worked. I knew enough statistics to understand the statistical errors in counting little spots in a dish. So \\nwhile all the biology guys were trying to understand these \"new\" things, I could spend my time learning the biology part. \\nThere was one useful lab technique I learned in that course which I still use today. They taught us how to hold a test tube and take its cap off \\nwith one hand (you use your middle and index fingers), while leaving the other hand free to do something else (like hold a pipette that you\\'re sucking \\ncyanide up into). Now, I can hold my toothbrush in one hand, and with the other hand, hold the tube of toothpaste, twist the cap off, and put it back \\non. \\nIt had been discovered that phages could have mutations which would affect their ability to attack bacteria, and we were supposed to study those \\nmutations. There were also some phages that would have a second mutation which would reconstitute their ability to attack bacteria. Some phages \\nwhich mutated back were exact ly the same as they were before. Others were not: There was a slight difference in their effect on bacteria--they would \\nact faster or slower than normal, and the bacteria would grow slower or faster than normal. In other words, there were \"back mutations, but they \\nweren\\'t always perfect; sometimes the phage would recover only part of the ability it had lost. \\nBob Edgar suggested that I do an experiment which would try to find out if the back mutations occurred in the same place on the DNA spiral. \\nWith great care and a lot of tedious work I was able to find three examples of back mutations which had occurred very close together--closer than \\nanything they had ever seen so far--and which partially restored the phage\\'s ability to function. It was a slow job. It was sort of accidental: You had to \\nwait around until von got a double mutation, which was very rare. \\nI kept trying to think of ways to make a phage mutate more often and how to detect mutations more quickly, but before I could come up with a \\ngood technique the summer was over, and I didn\\'t feel like continuing on that problem. \\nHowever, my sabbatical year was coming up, so I decided to work in the same biology lab but on a different subject. I worked with Matt \\nMeselson to some extent, and then with a nice fella from England named J. D. Smith. The problem had to do with ribosomes, the \"machinery\" in the \\ncell that makes protein from what we now call messenger RNA. Using radioactive substances, we demonstrated that the RNA could come out of \\nribosomes and could be put back in. \\nI did a very careful job in measuring and trying to control everything, but it took me eight months to realize that there was one step that was \\nsloppy. In preparing the bacteria, to get the ribosomes out, in those days you ground it up with alumina in a mortar. Everything else was chemical and \\nall under control, but you could never repeat the way you pushed the pestle around when you were grinding the bacteria. So nothing ever came of the \\nexperiment. \\nThen I guess I have to tell about the time I tried with Hildegarde Lamfrom to discover whether peas could use the same ribosomes as bacteria. \\nThe question was whether the ribosomes of bacteria can manufacture the proteins of humans or other organisms, She had just developed a scheme for \\ngetting the ribosomes out of peas and giving them messenger RNA so that they would make pea proteins. We realized that a very dramatic and \\nimportant question was whether ribosomes from bacteria, when given the peas\\' messenger RNA, would make pea protein or bacteria protein. It was \\nto be a very dramatic and fundamental experiment. \\nHildegarde said, \"I\\'ll need a lot of ribosomes from bacteria.\" \\nMeselson and I had extracted enormous quantities of ribosomes from E. coli for some other experiment. I said, \"Hell, I\\'ll just give you the \\nribosomes we\\'ve got. We have plenty of them in my refrigerator at the lab.\" \\nIt would have been a fantastic and vital discovery if I had been a good biologist. But I wasn\\'t a good biologist. We had a good idea, a good \\nexperiment, the right equipment, but I screwed it up: I gave her infected ribosomes--the grossest possible error that you could make in an experiment \\nlike that.

We were there at the right place, we were doing the right things, but I was doing things as an amateur--stupid and sloppy. \\nYou know what it reminds me of? The husband of Madame Bovary in Flaubert\\'s book, a dull country doctor who had some idea of how to fix \\nclub feet, and all he did was screw people up. I was similar to that unpracticed surgeon. \\nThe other work on the phage I never wrote up--Edgar kept asking me to write it up, hut I never got around to it. That\\'s the trouble with not being \\nin your own field: You don\\'t take it seriously. \\nI did write something informally on it. I sent it to Edgar, who laughed when he read it. It wasn\\'t in the standard form that biologists use--first, \\nprocedures, and so forth. I spent a lot of time explaining things that all the biologists knew. Edgar made a shortened version, hut I couldn\\'t understand \\nit. I don\\'t think they ever published it. I never published it directly. \\nWatson thought the stuff I had done with phages was of some interest, so he invited me to go to Harvard. I gave a talk to the biology department \\nabout the double mutations which occurred so close together. I told them my guess was that one mutation made a change in the protein, such as \\nchanging the pH of an amino acid, while the other mutation made the opposite change on a different amino acid in the same protein, so that it \\npartially balanced the first imitation-- not perfectly, but enough to let the phage operate again. I thought they were two changes in the same protein, \\nwhich chemically compensated each other. \\nThat turned out not to be the case. It was found out a few years later by people who undoubtedly developed a technique for producing and \\ndetecting the mutations faster, that what happened was, the first mutation was a mutation in which an entire DNA base was missing. Now the \"code\" \\nwas shifted and could not be read any more. The second mutation was either one in which an extra base was put back in, or two more were taken out. \\nNow the code could be read again. The closer the second mutation occurred to the first, the less message would he altered by the double mutation, \\nand the more completely the phage would recover its lost abilities. The fact that there are three \"letters\" to code each amino acid was thus \\ndemonstrated. \\nWhile I was at Harvard that week, Watson suggested something and we did an experiment together for a few days. It was an incomplete \\nexperiment, but I learned some new lab techniques from one of the best men in the field. \\nBut that was my big moment: I gave a seminar in the biology department of Harvard! I always do that, get into something and see how far I can \\ngo. \\nI learned a lot of things in biology, and I gained a lot of experience. I got better at pronouncing the words, knowing what not to include in a paper \\nor a seminar, and detecting a weak technique in an experiment. But I love physics, and I love to go back to it.'),\n",

He gave me a problem to work on, and it \\ngot hard, and I wasn\\'t getting anywhere. So I went back to an idea that I had had earlier, at MIT. The idea was that electrons don\\'t act on themselves, \\nthey only act on other electrons. \\nThere was this problem: When you shake an electron, it radiates energy and so there\\'s a loss. That means there must he a force on it. And there \\nmust he a different force when it\\'s charged than when it\\'s not charged. (If the force were exactly the same when it was charged and not charged, in \\none case it would lose energy, and in the other it wouldn\\'t. You can\\'t have two different answers to the same problem.) \\nThe standard theory was that it was the electron acting on itself that made that  force (called the force of radiation reaction), and I had only \\nelectrons acting on other electrons. So I was in some difficulty, I realized, by that time. (When I was at MIT, I got the idea without noticing the \\nproblem, but by the time I got to Princeton, I knew that problem.) \\nWhat I thought was: I\\'ll shake this electron. It will make some nearby electron shake, and the effect back from the nearly electron would be the \\norigin of the force of radiation reaction. So I did some calculations and took them to Wheeler. \\nWheeler, right away said, \"Well, that isn\\'t right because it varies inversely as the square of the distance of the other electrons, whereas it should \\nnot depend on any of these variables at all. It\\'ll also depend inversely upon the mass of the other electron; it\\'ll be proportional to the charge on the \\nother electron.\" \\nWhat bothered me was, I thought he must have done the calculation. I only realized later that a man like Wheeler could immediately see all that \\nstuff when you give him the problem. I had to calculate, but he could see. \\nThen he said, \"And it\\'ll he delayed--the wave returns late--so all you\\'ve described is reflected light.\" \\n\"Oh! Of course,\" I said. \\n\"But wait,\" he said. \"Let\\'s suppose it returns by advanced waves--reactions backward in time--so it comes back at the right time. We saw the \\neffect varied inversely as the square of the distance, but suppose there are a lot of electrons, all over space: the number is proportional to the square of \\nthe distance. So maybe we can make it all compensate.\" \\nWe found out we could do that. It came out very nicely, and fit very well. It was a classical theory that could be right, even though it differed \\nfrom Maxwell\\'s standard, or Lorentz\\'s standard theory. It didn\\'t have any trouble with the infinity of self-action, and it was ingenious. It had actions \\nand delays, forwards and backwards in time--we called it \"half-advanced and half-retarded potentials.\" \\nWheeler and I thought the next problem was to turn to the quantum theory of electrodynamics, which had difficulties (I thought) with the self-\\naction of the electron. We figured if we could get rid of the difficulty first in classical physics, and then make a quantum theory out of that, we could \\nstraighten out the quantum theory as well. \\nNow that we had got the classical theory right, Wheeler said, \"Feynman, you\\'re a young fella--you should give a seminar on this. You need \\nexperience in giving talks. Meanwhile, I\\'ll work out the quantum theory part and give a seminar on that later.\" \\nSo it was to be my first technical talk, and Wheeler made arrangements with Eugene Wigner to put it on the regular seminar schedule. \\nA day or two before the talk I saw Wigner in the hail. \"Feynman,\" he said, \"I think that work you\\'re doing with Wheeler is very interesting, so \\nI\\'ve invited Russell to the seminar.\" Henry Norris Russell, the famous, great astronomer of the day, was coming to the lecture! \\nWigner went on. \"I think Professor von Neumann would also he interested.\" Johnny von Neumann was the greatest mathematician around. \"And \\nProfessor Pauli is visiting from Switzerland, it so happens, so I\\'ve invited Professor Pauli to come\"--Pauli was a very famous physicist--and by this \\ntime, I\\'m turning yellow. Finally, Wigner said, \"Professor Einstein only rarely comes to our weekly seminars, but your work is so interesting that I\\'ve \\ninvited him specially, so he\\'s coming, too.\" \\nBy this time I must have turned green, because Wigner said, \"No, no! Don\\'t worry! I\\'ll just warn you, though: If Professor Russell falls asleep--\\nand he will undoubtedly fall asleep--it doesn\\'t mean that the seminar is bad; he falls asleep in all the seminars. On the other hand, if Professor Pauli is \\nnodding all the time, and seems to be in agreement as the seminar goes along, pay no attention. Professor Pauli has palsy.\" \\nI went back to Wheeler and named all the big, famous people who were coming to the talk he got me to give, and told him I was uneasy about it. \\n\"It\\'s all right,\" he said. \"Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll answer all the questions.\" \\nSo I prepared the talk, and when the day came, I went in and did something that young men who have had no experience in giving talks often do-\\n-I put too many equations up on the blackboard. You see, a young fella doesn\\'t know how to say, \"Of course, that varies inversely, and this goes this \\nway . . . because everybody listening already knows; they can see it. But he doesn\\'t know. He can only make it come out by actually doing the \\nalgebra--and therefore the reams of equations. \\nAs I was writing these equations all over the blackboard ahead of time, Einstein came in and said pleasantly, \"Hello, I\\'m coming to your seminar. \\nBut first, where is the tea?\" \\nI told him, and continued writing the equations. \\nThen the time came to give the talk, and here are these monster minds in front of me, waiting! My first technical talk--and I have this audience! I \\nmean they would put me through the wringer! I remember very clearly seeing my hands shaking as they were pulling out my notes from a brown \\nenvelope. \\nBut then a miracle occurred, as it has occurred again and again in my life, and it\\'s very lucky for me: the moment I start to think about the \\nphysics, and have to concentrate on what I\\'m explaining, nothing else occupies my mind--I\\'m completely immune to being nervous. So after I started \\nto go, I just didn\\'t know who was in the room. I was only explaining this idea, that\\'s all.'),\n",

It\\'s possible that that great man noticed the difficulty immediately and explained it to me in the question, hut I was so relieved at not \\nhaving to answer the questions that I didn\\'t really listen to them carefully. I do remember walking up the steps of Palmer Library with Pauli, who said \\nto me, \"What is Wheeler going to say about the quantum theory when he gives his talk?\" \\nI said, \"I don\\'t know. He hasn\\'t told me. He\\'s working it out himself.\" \\n\"Oh?\" he said. \"The man works and doesn\\'t tell his assistant what he\\'s doing \\'on the quantum theory?\" He came closer to me and said in a low, \\nsecretive voice, \"Wheeler will never give that seminar.\" \\nAnd it\\'s true. Wheeler didn\\'t give the seminar. He thought it would he easy to work out the quantum part; he thought he had it, almost. But he \\ndidn\\'t.
