## 1️⃣ Where to Find Option Data

## 2️⃣ What You’ll See in an Option Chain

An **option chain** shows all options for a particular underlying stock or index.

Here’s what you can expect:

| Column                      | Meaning                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Strike Price**            | Fixed price at which you can exercise (buy for Call, sell for Put) |
| **LTP (Last Traded Price)** | Latest premium price for that option                               |
| **Bid / Ask**               | Highest price someone is willing to pay / sell for the option      |
| **Open Interest (OI)**      | Number of outstanding contracts for that strike                    |
| **Volume**                  | Number of contracts traded today                                   |
| **Change**                  | Change in premium from previous day                                |

### Example (Simplified Option Chain)

| Strike Price | CE LTP | PE LTP | CE OI | PE OI |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 2500         | 85     | 10     | 1500  | 1200  |
| 2550         | 50     | 25     | 1300  | 1000  |
| 2600         | 25     | 60     | 1100  | 900   |

* Strike = 2500, 2550, 2600
* CE LTP = **Call premium**
* PE LTP = **Put premium**

When looking at the option chain, always check:

1. **Expiry** – Different months and weekly options exist

3. **Premium (LTP)** – That’s the price you pay per share
4. **Lot Size** – To calculate total investment
