LangChain is a framework for building applications with language models. 
- It connects to data sources and interacts with external environments.
- LangChain provides tools for document loading, text splitting, and embedding generation. 
- It also supports vector storage and retrieval, enabling efficient similarity searches. 
- With LangChain, developers can create pipelines that process and transform text data, 
- making it easier to integrate language models into real-world applications.
